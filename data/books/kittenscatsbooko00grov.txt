THE QUEEN 

I am the Queen of all the Kittens. 

I am the Queen ! the Queen ! 

Come, all you kittens and cats. 

Hear what I have to say. 

To-morrow I give a grand party. 

The party will be in my palace. 

You are all invited from the biggest to 
the littlest, from the oldest to the young- 
est, from the blackest to the whitest. 

So wash your paws and shine your fur. 

Forget your naughty tricks and do not 
one of you dare be late to your Queen's 
party. 

To-morrow at one o'clock.

GRANNY GKAY 

I am Granny Gray. 

I am very, very old, but I am going to 
the Queen's party. 

I am grandmother to a great many 
kittens. 

When any of them are naughty their 
mothers always send for me. 

When any of them are sick I always 

know what to do. 

. 

I teach them how to sing. 

I teach them how to scratch. 

I teach them how to catch mice. 

I am very, very old. 

They call me Granny Gray.

GETTING KEADY 

Hark, hark ! what is that noise ? 

No, I cannot play with you now. 

I must take my bath. 

I must get ready for the party. 

I have a new jacket and a new hat to 

wear. 

My pants were new last week, but they 

are not new now. 

I tore two holes in them when I climbed 
the apple tree in the back yard. 

Mother patched them, but someway the 
patches show more than the holes did. 

Perhaps my new jacket will cover the 
patches. I hope I shall look well dressed.

Mew ! mew ! mew ! mew ! 

Come, mother, come quickly ! 

We are all ready and waiting to start. 

Yes, we are all here. 

There are one, two, three, four of us. 

The carriage is pretty small, but we 
think we can all get in. 

We will be good this time and not 
push each other out. 

But please do come quickly, mother. 

It is hard to sit so still. 

Mew ! mew ! mew ! mew !

TIME TO START 

Dear me! my kittens are in such a 
hurry ! They give me no time to dress. 

It takes a very long time to shine my 
fur and to fix my bonnet. 

It is a new bonnet. This is the first time 
I have worn it. I hope it looks all right, 

I must practice sitting up straight and 
proper just for a minute. I want the 
Queen to know that I am a fine lady. 

I hope my kittens will not rough up 
their fur. If they do I shall have to 
shine it all over again. 

Now we must start. 

Where is their father ?

IS MY HAT ON STRAIGHT 

Here I am. Yes, I am the father of 
those four fine kittens. 

They are such beautiful kittens their 
mother does not eyen tie ribbons around 
their necks. 

I am glad of that, for I do not like 
ribbons. 

I must go now and take them all to 
the Queen's palace. I am sure they will 
be the handsomest kittens there. 

I suppose I shall have to push their 
carriage. 

Come, mother, let us be off. Are my 
whiskers stiff ? Is my hat on straight ?

Don't tell anybody where I am. 

I am hiding away from mother. 

She wants me to go to the Queens 
party and I don't want to go. 

I don't like the Queen, she is so grand 
and dignified. 

She frightens me. 

I would rather hide in this pitcher all 
day than go to the Queen's palace. 

Please don't tell where I am. 

You will not, will you ?

I've had an invitation 
To go to see the Queen, 

But I 'm a bashful kitten 
And I 'd rather not be seen. 



16 KITTENS AND CATS 

NO PAETY FOE ME 

How strange it is that some of us want 
to go to the party, and some do wo want 
to go. Some of us can go, and some can- 
not go. 

I am one who wants to go, and I am 
one who cannot go. 

I have a sick head. It aches. Perhaps 
I caught too many mice last night. 

The doctor has been here. He told me 
to take this medicine every half -hour. 

How I wish I could go to the party ! 

They surely will have something good 
to eat there, but I must stay at home and 
take my medicine.

I 'm off for the Queen's palace. 

I ? na the only cat in our country who 
has an automobile. 

But I suppose all the fine cats will be 
having them soon. 

It is really great fun to ride faster 
than any cat or kitten can run. 

I would invite you to ride too. but

there is room for only one. 
So, good-bye !

BEING WEIGHED 

Yes, I am being weighed. 

It frightens me to hang in the air like 

this. 

What if I should fall, with my feet 
tied up in this bag ! 

I am sure I should be killed ! 

Can you see how much I weigh? 

Nearly two pounds ? 

You don't mean it! 

Then I am big enough to go to the 
party all alone, though I am not sure 
that I want to go. 

I think I had rather stay at home and 
play.

Attention, kittens and cats ! The clock

I am the Commanding Officer of the 
palace. Attention to what I have to say ! 

Our Queen bids you welcome. 

She waits for you in her throne room. 

As you each pass in you must salute 
her and recite for her a cat tale, a rat 
tale, or some other tale, long or short, true 
or not. 

But no fears or tears, for our Queen 
has a fine dinner in her grand dining-room 
for all brave kittens and cats. 

Now who has the best tale ?

I am a famous singer among kittens

in big concerts. 

I wear a French bonnet when I sing. 
My voice is very soft and very sweet. 
I have come here to-day to sing for my 
Queen. 

Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r ! 
I '11 sing you a song. 
Though not very long, 
Yet I think it is as pretty as any. 
Put your hand in your purse. 
You'll never be worse, 
And give the sweet singer a penny.

A NURSE'S TALE 

I 'm the nurse who takes care of kit- 
tens and cats when they are sick. 

Sometimes they eat too much and have 
the stomach-ache. 

Sometimes they fall down stairs and 
bump their heads. 

Sometimes they get their tails bitten 



by bad dogs. 

Then their mothers send for me and I 
take care of them until they are well. 

I always wear a white dress and a 
white bonnet. 

If you ever get sick just send for me 
and I will take care of you.

I am a famous mouser. I have caught 
more mice than any other cat. 

I can see them afar off . 

I can hear them afar off. 

I can scent them afar off. 

They are all afraid of me. 

They scurry away whenever they see 
me coming. 

I wear soft pads on the bottom of my 
feet so they cannot hear me. 

I keep my teeth white and sharp. 

My friends call me * the Mouse Trap.' 

But I know a Kitty who is not a good

'THE MOUSE TRAP' 




34 KITTENS AKD CATS 

This is my story: 

A LONG TIME AGO 

Once there was a little Kitty, 

White as the snow; 
In the barn she used to frolic, 

Long time ago. 

In the barn a little Mousie. 

Ran to and fro; 
For she heard the Kitty coming, 

Long time ago. 

Nine pearl teeth had little Kitty, 
All in a row; 



A BOOK OF TALES 35 

And they bit the little Mousie, 
Long time ago. 

When the teeth bit little Mousie, 

Mousie cried, Oh! 
But she got away from Kitty, 

Long time ago. 

No mouse ever slipped through my 
paws like that, I am glad to say. 
I am a great mouser. 
Yes, I am a famous mouser, O Queen!

I could n't tell how many two and two

I could n't read my lesson. 

I couldn't say my A B C's. 

I could n't sing my song. 

So the teacher made me stand on a 
stool. Then she put this cap on my head. 

I have had to wear it ever since. 

After this I am going to study hard. 

I don't like to be called a dunce. 

I don't like to sit on a stool.

One day it rained and we could not 
go out of doors. 

So my brothers and sisters and I played 
Hide and Seek in the attic. 

All of a sudden one of my brothers 
said, ' I '11 tell you what let 's do ! ' 

'What's that?' we all asked together. 

6 Let 's dress up! It's lots of fun.' 

So we ran to the closet where father 
and mother keep their Sunday clothes. 

I put on father's trousers, and now I 
wear them every day. 

My brothers and sisters laugh at me.

WHO WAS HE 

I have a strange tale, O Queen. 

The other day I found a round glass. 

An old man was looking into the glass, 
so I looked in, and guess what I saw. 

I saw a cat looking straight at me. 

His face was white just like mine. 

His eyes had black spots in them just 
like mine, and his whiskers were long 
just like mine. 

When I said ' Mew ! ' he said ' Mew ! ' 

When I moved my paw, he moved his 
paw. 

When I ran away, he ran away too, so 
I never have found out who he was.

A SIGHT TO SEE 



The cat and the dog arid the kitten 
Were as brave as brave could be, 

But when they came to visit the Queen^ 
Why, they were a sight to see !

A 'FRAID-CAT'S TALE 

Once I was a 'fraid-cat, dear Queen. 
All the kittens and cats laughed at 
me and sang this song about me. 

C was a cat who ran after a rat, 
But her courage did fail 
When he seized on her tail. 

Now what do you think that cat did do? 

She jumped in a chair and cried, 

Mew! mew! 

I was the cat who ran after the rat. 
But my courage did fail 
When he seized on my tail. 

Mew! mew! 



MY COURAGE DID FAIL

FROM THE NORTH POLE 

I came from the land of the snow, 
from the land of the Eskimo, where the 
summer is all day and the winter is all 
night. 

We dress in fur coats up there. 

It 's cold, so cold one can hardly wink. 

But I am proud of my land, for the 
North Pole is there. 

The dogs have seen it. They tell us 
so. 

And what the dogs say is true, you 
know.

THE TWINS 

We are twin kittens. 

There are two of us, and we look just 
alike. 

Our brothers and sisters cannot tell us 
apart. 

Even our mother cannot tell us apart. 

When one of us says "Mew!" the 
other says "Mew!" 

When one is hungry, the other is 
hungry. 

When one is sleepy, the other is sleepy. 

We are afraid, dear Queen, that we are 
beginning to be sleepy right now. 

We have had such fun at your party!

She is looking straight at me. 

Oh dear! What if I should spill my

We '11 wear our bibs and hold our things

Spoons in right paws, cups in left, 

and make a pretty bow. 
We '11 always say, " Yes, if you please," 

and Only half of that." ' 
< Then go, my darling children,' said the 

happy Mother Cat. 
The seven little pussy-cats went out that 

night to tea. 
Their heads were smooth and glossy, their 

tails were swinging free ;

They held their things as they had 

learned, and tried to be polite ; 
With snowy bibs beneath their chins 

they were a pretty sight. 
But, alas for manners beautiful, and coats 

as soft as silk! 
The moment that the little kits were 

asked to take some milk, 
They dropped their spoons, forgot to 

bow, and oh, what do you think ? 
They put their noses in the cups and all 

began to drink! 
Yes, every naughty little kit set up a 

Mee-ow for more, 
Then knocked the tea-cup over, and 

scampered through the door.

CENTRAL CIRCULA7 : 

CHILDREN'S fiOOM 



A WORD TO THE TEACHER 

WHEN a new school Reader comes to the hands of the primary 
teacher, she naturally asks : ' Will this book give to my class of 
boys and girls a healthy stimulus of thought and pleasure? Will 
they receive through it valuable instruction and assistance in the 
mechanics of reading? Is the book sufficiently literary in style and 
artistic in form to command the respect and love of the children : 
Is it suggestive, dramatic, and ethically healthful? In a word, is it 
worth the precious time of the schoolroom ? " 

To the inquiring teacher who may examine this little book, which 
is devoted entirely to the frolics and fancies of kittens and cats, the 
following remarks may reveal a definite educational purpose and 
value in it. 

Following the example of Mother Goose, the wise and classic 
rhymester of the nursery, we have taken a subject dear to the heart 
of childhood and have given it life and personality in the simple and 
unsophisticated manner of the child. 

Many of the happiest playtime experiences of children are asso- 
ciated with their kittens. They delight to dress the frolicsome yet 
docile little creatures in doll gowns and jackets, and give them long 
rides in doll carriages, and make them sit at tiny tables and share in 
tea parties, then put them to bed and perhaps give them water medi- 
cine for an imaginary ill. Can there be a more normal and healthy 
pastime for a little child than this ? 

In one respect kittens take precedence over dolls. They are alive. 



82 A WOED TO THE TEACHEK 

They must be treated kindly. They will not bear the abuse and neg- 
lect given to many beautiful dolls. They demand attention and 
companionship, and they return a real devotion for kindness and 
care. Therefore we love them, and especially do our children love 
them and delight in stories or pictures of them. 

Those of us who have had glimpses of the child heart and mind 
know that stories of kittens and queens and parties yield much the 
same delight to the little reader of juvenile fiction, as do adventure 
and romance to the grown-up reader. 

This simple story about the Queen of the Kitten Country and the 
party which she gives in her palace, ought, therefore, to meet one of 
the most important requirements for a higher first grade school 
Reader, that of a strong appeal to the child in subject matter and 
illustration. With the interest keenly aroused the difficulties in 
learning to read are mastered quickly and with pleasure. However, 
the following brief suggestions are given to assist any teacher who 
may need them in making use of the book to the greatest advantage 
for her class. 

SUGGESTIONS 

Before the reading of the book is begun there might well be one 
or two story- telling periods. Each child should be encouraged to tell 
a story, from his own experience if possible, about a kitten, or a 
party, or to give his idea of a queen. 

The children should be assisted in recalling and in learning Mother 
Goose rhymes and other verses about cats. Give them several black- 
board drawing lessons showing cats in different positions and cos- 
tumes. A frieze of kittens may be started at the top of the black- 



A WORD TO THE TEACHER 83 

board, adding each new kitten character to the row as the story 
progresses. This frieze will furnish material for several varieties of 
'' busy work." 

A valuable exercise to stimulate thought and facility of expression 
is to assign a short page for a child to read silently, which he later 
gives aloud in his own words before the teacher and class. 

Interesting and profitable reviews may be frequently had by as- 
signing a cat character to each child, having them read in order the 
text devoted to their special character. The first review of this kind 
may well occur at the end of page twenty, where the preparations 
for the party are completed. When the party is over a final review 
may be given in dramatic form. The children should impersonate 
the different cats and tell their tales to amuse the Queen, who sits 
on her throne. This final dramatic review would naturally begin 
with the call of the Commanding Officer on page twenty-two. Each 
child should memorize his part and give it with spontaneous expres- 
sion and action. Slight costuming may be prepared if desired, or the 
blackboard frieze may furnish the cat pictures, while the children 
give life and action to them. 

Other special and valuable reviews may be developed from the 
large amount of verse in the book, each child choosing a favorite 
verse to read or recite or to illustrate on the blackboard. The child- 
ren should be encouraged to make rhyming sentences and word 
lists of their own, using the fundamental thought or words in the 
day's lesson as a basis. From such rhymes and lists of rhyming 
words, phonic work may be developed as the teacher chooses. 

There are about six hundred words in the vocabulary of " Kittens 
and Cats," and though it has not been mechanically graded, it should 



84 A WOKD TO THE TEACHER 

be within easy grasp of upper first grade pupils, after the usual 
Primer work is done. Each page of the book is a complete brief 
story well suited to the daily lesson period. These short stories are 
so related, however, as to make one continuous long story, thus keep- 
ing the interest of the children keen throughout the book. Books of 
this nature have proved a great stimulus to thoughtful and fluent 
reading, which, after all, is the high aim in primary work.

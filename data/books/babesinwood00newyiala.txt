THE  BABES  IN  THE  WOOD. 


THE  PARENT'S  DEATH. 


THE  BABES  IN  THE  WOOD. 


A  GENTLEMAN  of  good  account 

In  Norfolk  dwelt  of  late, 
Whose  wealth  and  riches  did  surmount 

Most  men  of  his  estate. 

Sore  sick  he  was,  and  like  to  die, 
No  help  his  life  could  save ; 

His  wife  by  him  as  sick  did  lie, 
And  both  were  near  the  grave. 

No  love  between  these  two  were  lost: 

Each  to  the  other  kind  ; 
In  love  they  lived,  in  love  they  died, 

And  left  two  babes  behind. 

Now  if  the  children  chanced  to  die, 
Ere  they  to  age  should  come, 

Their  uncle  should  possess  their  wealth : 
For  so  the  will  did  run. 


THE  TWO  KUFFIANS  CAKEY  OFF  THE  CHILDREN. 


THE   BABES    IN   THE    WOOD. 


"  Now,  brother/'  said  the  dying  man, 
"  Look  to  my  children  dear ; 

Be  good  unto  my  boy  and  girl, 
No  friends  else  have  they  here." 

Their  parents  being  dead  and  gone, 

The  children  home  he  takes, 
And  brings  them  both  unto  his  house. 

Where  much  of  them  he  makes. 

He  had  not  kept  these  pretty  babes 

A  twelvemonth  and  a  day, 
When,  for  their  wealth,  he  did  devise 

To  make  them  both  away. 

He  bargain'd  with  two  ruffians  bold, 

Who  were  of  savage  mood, 
That  they  should  take  the  children  twain, 

And  slay  them  in  a  wood. 

They  prate  and  prattle  pleasantly, 

While  riding  on  the  way, 
To  those  their  wicked  uncle  hired, 

These  lovely  babes  to  slay : 


THE  RUFFIANS  FIGHT. 


THE  CHILDREN  LOST. 


THE    BABES    IN    THE    WOOD. 


So  that  the  pretty  speech  they  had, 
Made  the  ruffian's  heart  relent ; 

And  they  that  took  the  deed  to  do, 
Full  sorely  did  repent. 

Yet  one  of  them,  more  hard  of  heart, 

Did  vow  to  do  his  charge, 
Because  the  wretch  that  hired  him 

Had  paid  him  very  large. 

The  other  would  not  agree  thereto, 

So  here  they  fell  at  strife ; 
With  one  another  they  did  fight, 

About  the  children's  life : 

And  he  that  was  of  milder  mood, 

Did  slay  the  other  there, 
Within  an  unfrequented  wood ; 

The  babes  did  quake  for  fear! 

He  took  the  children  by  the  hand, 
While  they  for  bread  complain : 

u  Stay  here/'  quoth  he,  ^Tll  bring  ye  bread, 
â€¢When  I  do  come  again."

THE  CHILD&EX  DEAD. 


THE    BABES    IN    THE    WOOD. 


These  pretty  babes,  with  hand  in  hand, 
Went  wandering  up  and  down ; 

But  never  more  they  saw  the  man 
Approaching  from  the  town: 

Thus  wander'd  these  two  pretty  dears, 
Till  death  did  end  their  grief; 

In  one  another's  arms  they  died, 
Poor  babes,  past  all  relief: 

No  burial  these  innocents 

Of  any  man  receives, 
But  robin  red-breast  lovingly 

Did  cover  them  with  leaves. 

The  fellow  that  did  take  in  hand 

These  children  for  to  kill, 
Was  for  a  robbery  judged  to  die, 

As  was  God;s  blessed  will: 

And  did  confess  the  very  truth, 
To  which  is  here  expressed ; 

Their  uncle  died,  while  he  for  debt 
Did  long  in  prison  rest.

MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 



OLD MOTHER GOOSE. 



OLD Mother Goose, when 
She wanted to wander, 

Would ride through the air 
On a very 'fine gander. 

Mother Goose had a house, 
'T was built in a wood, 

Where an owl at the door 
For sentinel stood. 

This is her son Jack, 
A plain-looking lad, 

He is not very good, 
Nor yet very bad. 

She sent him to market, 
A live goose he bought, 

" Here, mother," says he, 
" It will not go for nought.' 

Jack's goose and her gander 

Grew very fond, 
They 'd both eat together, 

Or swim in one pond. 

9 




"SHE SENT HIM TO MARKET, A LIVE GOOSE HE BOUGHT." 



OLD MOTHER GOOSE. II 

Jack found one fine morning 

As I have been told, 
His goose had laid him 

An egg of pure gold. 

Jack rode to his mother, 

The news for to tell, 
She called him a good boy 

And said it was well. 

Jack sold his gold egg 

To a rogue of a Jew, 
Who cheated him out of 

The half of his due. 



Then Jack went a-courting 

A lady so gay, 
As fair as the lily, 

And sweet as the May. 

The Jew and the Squire 
Came behind his back, 

And began to belabour 
The sides of poor Jack. 



And then the gold egg 
Was thrown into the sea, 






MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 




When Jack he jumped in, 
And got it back presently. 

The Jew got the goose, 

Which he vowed he would kill, 
Resolving at once 

His pockets to fill. 



OLD MOTHER GOOSE. 




Jack's mother came in, 

And caught the goose soon, 
And mounting its back, 

Flew up to the moon. 



MOTHER GOOSES NURSERY RHYMES. 




BOYS and girls, come out to play, 
The moon does shine as bright as day, 
Leave your supper, and leave your sleep, 
And meet your playfellows in the street; 
Come with a whoop, and come with a call, 
And come with a good will, or not at all. 
Up the ladder and down the wall, 
A halfpenny loaf will serve us all. 
You find milk and I '11 find flour, 
And we '11 have a pudding in half an hour.

THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER.* 

THE sun was shining on the sea, 

Shining with all his might : 
He did his very best to make 

The billows smooth and bright 
And this was >odd, because it was 

The middle of the night. 

The moon was shining sulkily, 
Because she thought the sun 
Had got no business to be there 

After the day was done 
"It's very rude of him," she said, 
" To come and spoil the fun ! " 

The sea was wet as wet could be, 

The sands were dry as dry. 
You could not see a cloud, because 

No cloud was in the sky : 
No birds were flying overhead 

There were no birds to fly. 



The Walrus and the Carpenter 
Were walking close at hand ; 

They wept like anything to see 

Such quantities of sand : 
"If this were only cleared away," 
They said, " it would be grand ! " 

* By permission of the Author. 
42 



THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER. 

" If seven maids with seven mops 

Swept it for half a year, 
Do you suppose," the Walrus said, 
" That they could get it clear ? " 
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter, 
And shed a bitter tear. 



43 




" O Oysters, come and walk with us ! 

The Walrus did beseech. 
" A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, 

Along the briny beach : 
We cannot do with more than four, 

To give a hand to each." 



The eldest Oyster looked at him, 
But never a word he said : 

The eldest Oyster winked his eye, 
And shook his heavy head 

Meaning to say he did not choose 
To leave the oyster-bed. 



44 MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

But four young Oysters hurried up, 

All eager for the treat : 
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed, 

Their shoes were clean and neat 
And this was odd, because, you know, 

They hadn't any feet. 

Four other Oysters followed them, 

And yet another four ; 
And thick and fast they came at last, 

And more, and more, and more 
All hopping through the frothy waves, 

And scrambling to the shore. 



The Walrus and the Carpenter 

Walked on a mile or so, 
And then they rested on a rock 

Conveniently low : 
And all the little Oysters stood 

And waited in a row. 

" The time has come," the Walrus said, 
" To talk of many things : 
Of shoes and ships and sealing-wax- 

Of cabbages and kings 
And why the sea is boiling hot 
And whether pigs have wings." 

" But wait a bit," the Oysters cried, 
" Before we have our chat ; 
For some of us are out of breath, 

And all of us are fat ! " 
" No hurry ! " said the Carpenter. 
They thanked him much for that. 



THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER. 



45 




" A loaf of bread," the Walrus said, 
"Is what we chiefly need : 
Pepper and vinegar besides 
Are very good indeed 
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear, 
We can begin to feed." 

" But not on us ! " the Oysters cried, 

Turning a little blue. 
" After such kindness, that would be 

A dismal thing to do ! " 
" The night is fine," the Walrus said. 
" Do vou admire the view ? 



"It was so kind of you to come ! 

And you are very nice ! " 
The Carpenter said nothing but 
" Cut us another slice : 
I wish you were not quite so deaf 
I Ve had to ask you twice ! " 



46 MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

" It seems a shame," the Walrus said, 
" To play them such a trick, 
After we've brought them out so far, 

And made them trot so quick ! " 
The Carpenter said nothing but 
" The butter 's spread too thick ! " 




" I weep for you," the Walrus said : 
" I deeply sympathize." 
With sobs and tears he sorted out 

Those of the largest size, 
Holding his pocket-handkerchief 
Before his streaming eyes. 



"O Oysters," said the Carpenter, 
" You Ve had a pleasant run ! 
Shall we be trotting home again ? " 

But answer there came none 
And this was scarcely odd, because 
They'd eaten every one.

"THERE WAS AN OWL LIVED is AN OAK.' 



50 



GOOD KING ARTHUR. 5T 

There was an Owl lived in an oak, 

Whiskey, Whaskey, Weedle ; 
And all the words he ever spoke 

Were Fiddle, Faddle, Feedle. 
A sportsman chanced to come that way, 

Whiskey, Whaskey, Weedle; 
Says he, " I '11 shoot you, silly bird, 

So Fiddle, Faddle, Feedle!" 




GOOD KING ARTHUR. 

WHEN good King Arthur ruled this land, 

He was a goodly King ; 
He bought three pecks of barley-meal, 

To make a bag-pudding. 

A bag-pudding the King did make, 
And stuffed it well with plums, 

And in it put great lumps of fat, 
As big as my two thumbs. 

The King and Queen did eat thereof, 

And noblemen beside ; 
And what they could not eat that night, 

The Queen next morning fried.

WHO STOLE THE BIRD'S-NEST? 



TO-WHIT! to-whit! to-whee ! 
Will you listen to me ? 
Who stole four eggs I laid, 
And the nice nest. I made ? 

Not I, said the cow, moo-oo ! 
Such a thing I 'd never do. 
I gave you a wisp of hay, 
But did not take your nest 

away; 

Not I, said the cow, moo-oo ! 
Such a thing I 'd never do. 

Bob-o-link ! Bob-o-link ! 
Now, what do you think ? 
Who stole a nest away 
From the plum-tree to-day ? 




54 MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

Not I, said the dog, bow-wow ! 
I wouldn't be so mean, I vow. 
I gave some hairs the nest to 

make, 

But the nest I did not take ; 
Not I, said the dog, bow-wow ! 
I would not be so mean, I vow. 

Coo-coo ! coo-coo ! coo-coo ! 
Let me speak a word or two : 
Who stole that pretty nest 
From little Robin Redbreast ? 

Not I, said the sheep ; oh, no, 
I would not treat a poor bird 

so; 

I gave the wool the nest to line, 
But the nest was none of mine. 
Baa ! baa ! said the sheep ; oh, 

no! 
I wouldn't treat a poor bird so. 

V Caw ! caw ! cried the crow, 
I should like to know 
What thief took away 
A bird's-nest to-day. 




WHO STOLE THE EIRD'S-NEST? 

Chuck ! chuck ! said the hen, 
Don't ask me again ; 
Why, I haven't a chick 
Would do such a trick. 
We all gave her a feather, 
And she wove them together. 
I 'd scorn to intrude 
On her and her brood. 
Chuck ! chuck ! said the hen, 
Don't ask me again.

Chirr-a- whirr ! chirr-a- whirr ! 
We will make a great stir. 
Let us find out his name, 
And all cry For shame ! 

A little boy hung down his 

head,

For he stole that pretty nest 
From little Robin Redbreast ; 
And he felt so full of shame 
He did not like to tell his name.

THERE WAS A JOLLY MILLER. 

There was a jolly miller 

Lived on the river Dee : 
He worked and sang from morn till night, 

No lark so blithe as he. 
And this the burden of his song 

For ever used to be 

I care for nobody no ! not I, 
Since nobody cares for me.

"JENNY BLUSHED BEHIND HER FAN." 



84 




THE MARRIAGE OF COCK ROBIN AND 
JENNY WREN. 

IT was on a merry time, 
When Jenny Wren was young, 

So neatly as she danced, 

And so sweetly as she sung, 

Robin Redbreast lost his heart: 

He was a gallant bird ; 
He doffed his hat to Jenny, 

And thus to her he said: 



86 



MOTHER GOOSES NURSERY RHYMES. 




" My dearest Jenny Wren, 

If you will but be mine, 
You shall dine on cherry-pie, 
And drink nice currant-wine. 



" I '11 dress you like a goldfinch, 

Or like a peacock gay; 
So if you'll have me, Jenny, 
Let us appoint the day," 



MARRIAGE OF COCK ROSIN AND JENNY WREN. 87 




Jenny blushed behind her fan, 

And thus declared her mind: 
" Then let it be to-morrow, Bob, 
I take your offer kind; 



" Cherry-pie is very good, 

So is currant-wine ; 
But I '11 wear my russet gown, 
And never dress too fine." 



MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 




Robin rose up early, 

At the break of day; 
He flew to Jenny Wren's house, 

To sing a roundelay. 

He met the Cock and Hen, 
And bade the Cock declare, 

This was his wedding-day 
With Jenny Wren the fair. 

The Cock then blew his horn, 
To let the neighbours know 

This was Robin's wedding-day, 
And they might see the show. 



MARRIAGE OF COCK ROBIN AND JENNY WREN. 89 




At first came Parson Rook, 
With his spectacles and band ; 

And one of Mother Hubbard's books 
He held within his hand. 

Then followed him the Lark, 
For he could sweetly sing, 

And he was to be the clerk 
At Cock Robin's wedding. 

He sang of Robin's love 

For Little Jenny Wren ; 
And when he came unto the end, 

Then he began again. 



90 MOTHER GOOSES NURSERY RHYMES. 

The Goldfinch came on next, 
To give away the Bride ; 

The Linnet, being- bridesmaid, 
Walked by Jenny's side ; 

And as she was a-walking, 
Said, " Upon my word, 

I think that your Cock Robin 
Is a very pretty bird." 

The Blackbird and the Thrush, 
And charming Nightingale, 

Whose sweet "jug" sweetly echoes 
Through every grove and dale; 

The Sparrow and Tomtit, 
And many more, were there ; 

All came to see the wedding 
Of Jenny Wren the fair. 

The Bullfinch walked by Robin, 

And thus to him did say, 
" Pray mark, friend Robin Redbreast, 
That Goldfinch dressed so gay: 

"What though her gay apparel 

Becomes her very well, 
Yet Jenny's modest dress and look 
Must bear away the bell." 



MARRIAGE OF COCK ROBIN AND JENNY WREN. 9 1 




Then came the Bride and Bridegroom; 

Quite plainly was she dressed, 
And blushed so much, her cheeks were 

As red as Robin's breast. 

But Robin cheered her up; 
" My pretty Jen," said he, 
; We 're going to be married, 
And happy we shall be." 



Q2 MOTHER GOOSES NURSERY RHYMES. 

" Oh, then," says Parson Rook, 
" Who gives this maid away ? " 

" I do," says the Goldfinch, 
" And her fortune I will pay : 

"Here's a bag of grain of many sorts, 

And other things beside : 
Now happy be the bridegroom, 
And happy be the bride ! " 

"And will you have her, Robin, 

To be your wedded wife ? " 
" Yes, I will," says Robin, 
" And love her all my life ! " 

"And you will have him, Jenny, 

Your husband now to be ? " 
"Yes, I will," says Jenny, 
" And love him heartily ! " 

Then on her finger fair 

Cock Robin put the ring; 
"You're married now, "says Parson Rook, 
While the Lark aloud did sing: 

" Happy be the bridegroom, 

And happy be the bride! 
And may not man, nor bird, nor beast, 
This happy pair divide!" 



MARRIAGE OF COCK ROBIN AND JENNY WREN. 




The birds were asked to dine, 
Not Jenny's friends alone, 

But every pretty songster 

That had Cock Robin known. 

They had a cherry-pie, 

Besides some currant-wine, 

And every guest brought something, 
That sumptuous they might dine. 

Now they all sat or stood, 

To eat and to drink; 
And every one said what 

He happened to think. 



94 



MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 




They each took a bumper, 
And drank to the pair, 

Cock Robin the bridegroom, 
And Jenny the fair. 

The dinner-things removed, 
They all began to sing; 

And soon they made the place 
Near a mile round to ring. 

The concert it was fine; 

And every bird tried 
Who best should sing for Robin, 

And Jenny Wren the bride. 



MARRIAGE OF COCK ROBIN AND JENNY WREN. 95 




When in came the Cuckoo, 
And made a great rout; 

He caught hold of Jenny, 
And pulled her about. 

Cock Robin was angry, 
And so was the Sparrow, 

Who fetched in a hurry 
His bow and his arrow. 

His aim then he took, 
But he took it not right ; 

His skill was not good, 
Or he shot in a frigfrt; 



MOTHER GOOSES NURSERY RHYMES. 

For the Cuckoo he missed, 

But Cock Robin he killed I- 
And all the birds mourned 
That his blood was so spilled. 




Alas ! Poor Cock Robin !

FREDDIE AND THE CHERRY-TREE. 



RE DD I E saw some fine ripe cherries 

Hanging on a cherry-tree, 
And he said, " You pretty 

cherries, 

Will you not come down to 
me ?" 

" Thank you kindly," said a cherry, 
" We would rather stay up here ; 

If we ventured down this morning, 
You would eat us up, I fear." 

One, the finest of the cherries, 
Dangled from a slender twig; 

__ " You are beautiful," said Freddie, 
" Red and ripe, and oh, how big!" 

"Catch me," said the cherry, "catch me, 

Little master, if you can." 
"I would catch you soon," said Freddie, 
" If I were a grown-up man." 

Freddie jumped, and tried to reach it, 

Standing high upon his toes; 
But the cherry bobbed about, 

And laughed, and tickled Freddie's nose.

Heigho, says Rowley,

Heigho, says Rowley, 

A lily-white duck came and gobbled him up.

There was an old woman, as I 've heard tell, 
She went to market her eggs for to sell ; 
She went to market all on a market day, 
And she fell asleep on the King's highway. 

There came by a pedlar, whose name was Stout, 

He cut her petticoats all round about; 

He cut her petticoats up to the knees, 

Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze. 

When the little old woman first did wake, 
She began to shiver and she began to shake; 
She began to wonder, and she began to cry, 
" Lauk a mercy on me, this can't be I ! 



HIGH DIDDLE DING.

But if it be I, as I hope it be, 

I 've a little dog at home, and he '11 know me ; 

If it be I, he'll wag his little tail, 

And if it be not I, he'll loudly bark and wail." 

Home went the little woman all in the dark, 
Up got the little dog, and he began to bark ; 
He began to bark, so she began to cry, 
" Lauk a mercy on me, this is none of I!" 



High diddle ding, 

Did you hear the bells ring ? 

The Parliament soldiers are gone to the King! 

Some they did laugh, some they did cry,

THE ROBIN REDBREASTS. 

Two Robin Redbreasts built their nests 

Within a hollow tree ; 
The hen sat quietly at home, 

The cock sang merrily ; 
And all the little young ones said, 
"Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee." 

One day (the sun was warm and bright, 
And shining in the sky), 

138 



THE ROBIN REDBREASTS. 

Cock Robin said, " My little dears, 

'T is time you learn to fly ; " 
And all the little young ones said, 
"I'll try, I'll try, I'll try." 

I know a child, and who she is 

I '11 tell you by-and-by, 
When Mamma says, " Do this," or "that," 

She says, "What for?" and "Why?" 
She'd be a better child by far 

If she would say "I '11 try."

THE GREAT BROWN OWL 

THE Brown Owl sits in the ivy-bush, 

And she looketh wondrous wise, 
With a horny beak beneath her cowl, 

And a pair of large round eyes. 

She sat all day on the selfsame spray, 

From sunrise till sunset ; 
And the dim grey light, it was all too bright 

For the Owl to see in yet. 

" Jenny Owlet, Jenny Owlet," said a merry little bird,. 
" They say you 're wondrous wise ; 
But I don't think you see, though you 're looking 

at ME 
With your large, round, shining eyes." 

But night came soon, and the pale white moon 

Rolled high up in the skies; 
And the great Brown Owl flew away in her cowl,. 

With her large, round, shining eyes.

DAME DUCK'S LESSONS TO HER 
DUCKLINGS. 

OLD MOTHER DUCK has hatched a brood 
Of ducklings, small and callow : 

Their little wings are short, their down 
Is mottled grey and yellow. 

There is a quiet little stream, 

That runs into the moat, 
Where tall green sedges spread their leaves, 

And water-lilies float. 

Close by the margin of the brook 
The old Duck made her nest, 

150 



DAME DUCKS LESSON TO HER DUCKLINGS. 151 

Of straw, and leaves, and withered grass, 
And down from her own breast. 

And there she sat for four long weeks, 

In rainy days and fine, 
Until the Ducklings all came out 

Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. 

One peeped out from beneath her wing, 

One scrambled on her back : 
" That 's very rude," said old Dame Duck, 
" Get off ! quack, quack, quack, quack ! " 

" 'T is close," said Dame Duck, shoving out 

The egg-shells with her bill, 
" Besides, it never suits young ducks 

To keep them sitting still." 

So, rising from her nest, she said, 
" Now, children, look at me : 
A well-bred duck should Waddle so, 
From side to side d' ye see ? " 

' Yes," said the little ones, and then 

She went on to explain : 
"A well-bred duck turns in its toes 

As I do try again." 

"Yes," said the Ducklings, waddling on. 

"That's better," said their mother; 
" But well-bred ducks ^'alk in a row, 
Straight one behind another." 



152 MOTHER GOOSES NURSERY RHYMES. 

''Yes/' said the little Ducks again, 

All waddling in a row : 
" Now to the pond," said old Dame Duck 

Splash, splash ! and in they go. 

" Let me swim first," said old Dame Duck, 
" To this side, now to that ; 
There, snap at those great brown-winged flies, 
They make young ducklings fat. 

"Now when you reach the poultry-yard, 

The hen-wife, Molly Head, 
Will feed you, with the other fowls, 
On bran and mashed-up bread ; 

"' The hens will peck and fight, but mind, 

I hope that all of you 
Will gobble up the food as fast 
As well-bred ducks should do. 

'" You 'd better get into the dish, 

Unless it is too small; 
In that case, I should use my foot, 
And overturn it all." 

The Ducklings did as they were bid, 

And found the plan so good, 
That, from that day, the other fowls 

Got hardly any food.

THE YOUNG LINNETS. 

DID you ever see the nest 
Of Chaffinch or of Linnet, 

When the little downy birds 
Are lying snugly in it, 

Gaping wide their yellow mouths 
For something nice to eat ? 

Caterpillar, worm, and grub, 
They reckon dainty meat. 

When the mother-bird returns, 
And finds them still and good,

A proper share of food.

And peeped with knowing eye' 
Into all the folded leaves 

Where caterpillars lie. 

She has searched among the grass, 

And flown from tree to tree, 
Catching gnats and flies, to feed 

Her little family. 

I have seen the Linnets chirp, 

And shake their downy wings : 
They are pleased to see her come, 

And pleased with what she brings. 

But I never saw them look 

Impatient for their food: 
Somebody, at dinner-time, 

Is seldom quite so good.

The Fox when he came to yonder stile, 
He lifted his ears, and he listened awhile; 
Oh, ho ! " said the Fox, " it 's but a short mile 
From this unto yonder town, heigho ! " 

The Fox when he came to the farmer's gate, 
Whom should he see but the farmer's Drake; 
I love you well for your master's sake, 
And long to be picking your bones, heigho!"

And out of the window she popped her head ; 
"Oh, husband! oh, husband! the Geese are all dead, 
For the Fox has been through the town, heigho ! " 

The farmer he loaded his pistol with leau, 
And shot the old rogue of a Fox through the head ; 
" Ah, ha ! " said the farmer, " I think you 're quite dead, 
And no more you'll trouble the town, heigho!"

As I was going up Primrose Hill, 

Primrose Hill was dirty;

She sat by the fire and told many a fine tale.

Would make a baby cry and

THE TURTLE-DOVE'S NEST. 

VERY high in the pine-tree, 

The little Turtle-dove 
Made a pretty little nursery, 

To please her little love. 
She was gentle, she was soft, 

And her large dark eye 
Often turned to her mate, 

Who was sitting close by. 

"Coo," said the Turtle-dove, 

" Coo," said she ; 
"Oh, I love thee," said the Turtle-dove. 

"And I love THEE." 

215 



216 MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

In the long shady branches 

Of the dark pine-tree, 
How happy were the Doves 

In their little nursery ! 

The young Turtle-doves 

Never quarrelled in the nest; 

For they dearly loved each other, 

Though they loved their mother best 
"Coo," said the little Doves. 

"Coo," said she. 

And they played together kindly 
In the dark pine-tree. 

In this nursery of yours, 

Little sister, little brother, 
Like the Turtle-dove's nest 

Do you love one another ? 
Are you kind, are you gentle, 

As children ought to be ? 
Then the happiest of nests 

Is your own nursery.

Wherever he goes, 
And that stands all awry.

Must rise at five ; 
He that hath thriven, 
May lie till seven ; 
And he that by the plough 

would thrive, 

Himself must either hold or 
drive.

Daddy is near; 
Mamma is a lady, 

And that's very clear.

THE FROG'S CHORUS.

Said the croaking voice of a Frog : 

"A rainy day 

In the month of May, 
And plenty of room in the bog." 

"Yaup, yaup, yaup!" 
Said the Frog as it hopped away: 

"The insects feed 

On the floating weed, 
And I 'm hungry for dinner to-day." 

" Yaup, yaup, yaup ! " 
Said the Frog, as it splashed, about : 

"Good neighbours all, 

When you hear me call, 
It is odd that you do not come out." 

" Yaup, yaup, yaup ! " 

Said the Frogs; "it is charming weather; 
We '11 come and sup, 
When the moon is up, 

And we'll all of us croak together."

went the old woman to the cow, and said

the hay." So away the old woman went ; but when she got 
to the stream, she found the bucket was full of holes. So 
she covered the bottom with pebbles, and then filled the 
bucket with water, and away she went back with it to the 
haymakers ; and they gave her a wisp of hay. 

As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the old 
woman the milk ; and away she went with it in a saucer to 
the cat. As soon as the cat had lapped up the milk 

The cat began to kill the rat; 
The rat began to gnaw the rope; 
The rope began to hang the butcher; 
The butcher began to kill the ox; 
The ox began to drink the water; 
The water began to quench the fire ; 
The fire began to burn the stick; 
The stick began to beat the dog; 
The dog began to bite the pig;

And the thick mud has covered his legs and his feet, 
But yet on he galloped in spite of the rain, 
And has brought papa home to his darling again.

And papa could not see the road where he should go, 
But Dobbin kept on through the desolate wild, 
And has brought papa home again safe to his child.

Go, Dobbin, and rest your old bones on the straw ;

SHOWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE INTENDED, 
AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN. 

JOHN GILPIN was a citizen 

Of credit and renown, 
A train-band captain eke was he, 

Of famous London town. 

John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear, 
" Though wedded we have been 
These twice ten tedious years, yet we 
No holiday have seen. 

" To-morrow is our wedding-day, 

And we will then repair 
Unto the "Bell" at Edmonton, 
All in a chaise and pair. 



268 MOTHER GOOSES NURSERY RHYMES. 

" My sister, and my sister's child, 

Myself, and children three, 
Will fill the chaise; so you must ride 
On horseback after we." 



He soon replied, " I do admire 

Of womankind but one, 
And you are she, my dearest dear, 

Therefore it shall be done. 

I am a linendraper bold, 

As all the world doth know, 

And my good friend the calender 
Will lend his horse to go." 

Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said; 

And for that wine is dear, 
We will be furnished with our own, 

Which is both bright and clear." 

John Gilpin kissed his loving wife; 

O'erjoyed was he to find, 
That though on pleasure she was bent, 

She had a frugal mind. 



THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN. 269 




The morning came, the chaise was brought, 

But yet was not allowed 
To drive up to the door, lest all 

Should say that she was proud. 

So three doors off the chaise was stayed, 
Where they did all get in; 



270 MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

Six precious souls, and all agog 
To dash through thick and thin. 

Smack went the whip, round went the wheels, 

Were never folks so glad ! 
The stones did rattle underneath, 

As if Cheapside were mad. 

John Gilpin at his horse's side 

Seized fast the flowing mane, 
And up he got, in haste to ride, 

But soon came down again. 

For saddletree scarce reached had he, 

His journey to begin. 
When, turning round his head, he saw 

Three customers come in. 

So down he came ; for loss of time, 

Although it grieved him sore, 
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew, 

Would trouble him much more, 

Twas long before the customers 
Were suited to their mind, 



THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN. 271 

When Betty screaming came downstairs, 
" The wine is left behind ! " 



" Good lack ! " quoth he, " yet bring it me, 

My leathern belt likewise, 
In which I bear my trusty sword 
When I do exercise." 

Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul !) 

Had two stone bottles found, 
To hold the liquor that she loved, 

And keep it safe and sound. 

Each bottle had a curling ear, 
Through which the belt he drew, 

And hung a bottle on each side, 
To make his balance true. 

Then over all, that he might be 

Equipped from top to toe, 
His long red cloak, well brushed and neat, 

He manfully did throw. 

Now see him mounted once again 
Upon his nimble steed, 



272 MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

Full slowly pacing o'er the stones, 
With caution and good heed. 

But finding soon a smoother road 

Beneath his well-shod feet, 
The snorting beast began to trot, 

Which galled him in his seat. 

"So, fair and softly!" John he cried, 

But John he cried in vain ; 
That trot became a gallop soon, 
In spite of curb and rein. 

So stooping down, as needs he must 

Who cannot sit upright, 
He grasped the mane with both his hands, 

And eke with all his might. 

His horse, who never in that sort 

Had handled been before, 
What thing upon his back had got, 

Did wonder more and more. 

Away went Gilpin, neck or nought; 
Away went hat and wig; 



THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPfN. 273 




He little dreamt, when he set out, 
Of running such a rig. 

The wind did blow, the cloak did fly 

Like streamer long and gay, 
Till, loop and button failing both, 

At last it flew away. 

is 



274 MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

Then might all people well discern 

The bottles he had slung ; 
A bottle swinging at each side, 

As hath been said or sung. 

The dogs did bark, the children screamed, 

Up flew the windows all ; 
And every soul cried out, " Well done ! " 

As loud as he could bawl. 

Away went Gilpin who but he ? 
His fame soon spread around : 
" He carries weight ! he rides a race ! 
'T is for a thousand pound ! " 

And still as fast as he drew near, 

'Twas wonderful to view 
How in a trice the turnpike-men 

Their gates wide open threw. 

And now, as he went bowing down 

His reeking head full low, 
The bottles twain behind his back 

Were shattered at a blow. 



THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILF1N. 275 

Down ran the wine into the road, 

Most piteous to be seen, 
Which made the horses flanks to smoke 

As they had basted been. 

But still he seemed to carry weight, 

With leathern girdle braced ; 
For all might see the bottle-necks 

Still dangling at his waist. 

Thus all through merry Islington 

These gambols he did play, 
Until he came unto the Wash 

Of Edmonton so gay ; 

And there he threw the wash about 

On both sides of the way, 
Just like unto a trundling mop, 

Or a wild goose at play. 

At Edmonton his loving wife 

From the balcony spied 
Her tender husband, wondering much 

To see how he did ride.

276 MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

"Stop, stop, John Gilpin! Here's the house! 1 

They all at once did cry ; 
" The dinner, waits, and we are tired ; " 

Said Gilpin " So am I ! " 

But yet his horse was not a whit 

Inclined to tarry there ; 
For why ?- his owner had a house 

Full ten miles off, at Ware. 

So like an arrow swift he flew, 

Shot by an archer strong; 
So did he fly which brings me to 

The middle of my song. 

Away went Gilpin out of breatb 

And sore against his will, 
Till at his friend the calender's, 

His horse at last stood still. 



The calender, amazed to see 
His neighbour in such trim, 

Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate, 
And thus accosted him : 



I HE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN. 277 




" What news ? what news ? your tidings tell ; 

Tell me you must and shall 
Say why bareheaded you are come, 
Or why you come at all ?" 

Now Gilp'm had a pleasant wit, 
And loved a timely joke ; 



2;S MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

And thus unto the calender 
In merry guise he spoke : 

" I came because your horse would come : 

And, if I well forebode, 
My hat and wig will soon be here, 
They are upon the road." 

The calender, right glad to find 

His friend in merry pin, 
Returned him not a single word, 

But to the house went in ; 

Whence straight he came with hat and wig, 

A wig that flowed behind, 
A hat not much the worse for wear, 

Each comely in its kind. 

He held them up, and in his turn 

Thus showed his ready wit, 
"My head is twice as big as yours, 
They therefore needs must fit 

" But let me scrape the dirt away, 
That hangs upon your face ; 



THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN. 279 




And stop and eat, for well you may 
Be in a hungry case." 

Said John, "It is my wedding-day, 
And all the world would stare 

If wife should dine at Edmonton, 
And I should dine at Ware." 



2 So MOTHER GOOSE'S NURSERY RHYMES. 

So turning to his horse, he said, 
" I am in haste to dine ; 
'Twas for your pleasure you came here, 
You shall go back for mine." 

Ah ! luckless speech, and bootless boast ! 

For which he paid full dear; 
For while he spake, a braying ass 

Did sing most loud and clear; 

Whereat his horse did snort, as he 

Had heard a lion roar, 
And galloped off with all his might, 

As he had done before. 

Away went Gilpin, and away 
Went Gilpin's hat and wig : 

He lost them sooner than at first, 
For why they were too big. 

Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw 
Her husband posting down 

Into the country far away, 
She pulled out half-a-crown ; 



THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF. JOHN GILPIN. 281 




And thus unto the youth she said 
That drove them to the "Bell," 

This shall be yours when you bring back 
My husband safe and well." 

The youth did ride, and soon did meet 
John coming back amain ; 



282 MOTHER GOOSES NURSERY RHYMES. 

Whom in a trice he tried to stop, 
By catching at his rein ; 

But not performing what he meant, 
And gladly would have done, 

The frighted steed he frighted more, 
And made him faster run. 

Away went Gilpin, and away 
Went postboy at his heels. 

The postboy's horse .right glad to miss 
The lumbering of the wheels. 

Six gentlemen upon the road, 

Thus seeing Gilpin fly, 
W 7 ith postboy scampering in the rear, 

They raised the hue and cry. 

" Stop thief ! stop thief ! a highwayman ! ' 

Not one of them was mute ; 
And all and each that passed that way 
Did join in the pursuit. 

And now the turnpike-gates again 
Flew open in short space; 



I HE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN G1LPIN. 283 




The toll-men thinking, as before, 
That Gilpin rode a race. 

And so he did, and won it too, 

For he got first to town ; 
Nor stopped till where he had got up, 

He did again get down. 

Now let us sing, Long live the King, 

And Gilpin, long live he; 
And when he next doth ride abroad, 

May I be there to see. 



284 MOTHER GOOSES NURSERY RHYMES. 




Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
How I wonder what you are ! 
Up above the world so high. 
Like a diamond in the sky. 



TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR, 285 

When the blazing sun is gone, 
When he nothing shines upon, 
Then you show your little light, 
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. 

Then the traveller in the dark 
Thanks you for your tiny spark : 
How could he see where to go, 
If you did not twinkle so ? 

In the dark blue sky you keep, 
Often through my curtains peep, 
For you never shut your eye, 
Till the sun is in the sky. 

As your bright and tiny spark 
Lights the traveller in the dark, 
Though I know not what you are, 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

A MAN OF WORDS AND NOT OF

A MAN of words and not of deeds 

Is like a garden full of weeds ; 

And when the weeds begin to grow, 

It's like a garden full of snow; 

And when the snow begins to fall, 

It 's like a bird upon the wall ; 

And when the bird away does fly, 

It's like an eagle in the sky; 

And when the sky begins to roar, 

It 's like a lion at the door ; 

And when the door begins to crack, 

It's like a stick across your back; 

And when your back begins to smart, 

It's like a penknife in your heart; 

And when your heart begins to bleed, 

You're dead, and dead, and dead indeed.

THREE CHILDREN SLIDING ON THE ICE. 301 




Three children sliding on the ice, 

All on a summer's day, 
As it fell out they all fell in, 

The rest they ran away.

Or sliding on dry ground, 
Ten thousand pounds to one penny 

They had not all been drowned.

And you, too, that have none, 

If you would have them safe abroad, 
Pray keep them safe at home.

As I Ve been plainly told, sir, they reached up to the sky ; 

The sky, the sky, the sky ; 
As I Ve been plainly told, sir, they reached up to the sky.

And it was sent to Derby to toll the market bell; 

The bell, the bell, the bell ; 
And it was sent to Derby to toll the market bell.

MY LADY WIND.

My Lady Wind, my Lady Wind, 
Went round about the house, to find 

A chink to get her foot in; 
She tried the keyhole in the door, 
She tried the crevice in the floor, 

And drove the chimney soot in. 

And then one night when it was dark, 
She blew up such a tiny spark, 

That all the house was pothered; 
From it she raised up such a flame 
As flamed away to Belting Lane, 

And White Cross folks were smothered.

A whisper reaches itching ears,

THE 


FARM     YARD 


ALPHABET. 


A    stands    for    the    Ass,    who    eats

He  is  useful   and   patient,  though  only 
an  Ass.

and  there, 

And  bring  to  the  hives  the  sweet  honey 
with  care.

trees ; 

They   are   chewing   the  cud,  and  seem 
quite  at  their  ease.

playing  together ; 

They  care  not  for  rain  nor  the  stormiest 
weather. 


Efor  the    Eggs,  which   we    find   in 
the  nest; 

They   still   feel   quite   warm,    from   the 
hen's  downy  breast.

cocks. 

Take  care,    my  fine   birdies,  beware  of

strong ; 

He  draws  the  hay-cart  to  the  meadow 
along. 


I   is  the  Isle;    and  I'll   mention   my 
wish 

To   sit   on   the   bank,   in   the   summer, 
and  fish. 


Kare  the  Kittens,   that  live  in  the 
stable ; 

They  will   catch   all  the  mice  as  soon 
as  they're  able. 


Lis    for    Lucy,    who  waits   at   the 
stile, 

And  puts  down  the  pail,  for  she's  resting 
awhile. 


Mis    the    Milk,    which    is     good, 
Pussy  thinks, 

And     so,     uninvited     and     slyly,      she 
drinks. 


N    stands    for   the  Nuts;     and  when 
lessons  are  done, 

Two  boys   can  go  nutting  much  better 
than  one. 


Ofor  the  Owl,  that  flies  out  in  the 
night, 

And   sails   o'er   the    barn   in   the   quiet 
moonlight. 


Pfor  some  Pigs,  which  have  strayed 
from  their  sty, 

But  of  course  will   return  there  to  bed 
by-and-by.

plucked  from  a  tree, 

To    flavour  the  tart  Mary's  making  for 
me. 


Rfor   the    Rabbits,    white,   spotted, 
and  gray  ; 

Just   see    how    that    little    one    nibbles 
away. 


Sfor  the  Sheep,  with  their  coats  of 
soft  wool. 

They  stand  in  the  meadows  so  pleasant 
and  cool. 


Tfor  the  Turkey,  who  stately  doth 
sail, 

With   long   sweeping   wings   and  wide- 
spreading  tail. 


Vfor  the  Vine,  growing  high  on  the 
wall ; 

Take  care,  little  boy,  or  you  surely  will 
fell. 


Wfor  Waggon,  that  stands  empty 
alone 

Near  the  trees  in  the  fields  when  the 
horses  are  gone. 


X 


put  on  a  barrel,  is  intended  to  tell 

The  strength  of  the  beer,  and  its  flavour 
as  well. 


Yis  the  Yard,  where  the  chicks  love 
to  feed 

On  the  oats,  and  the  barley,  and  other 
good  seed. 


f>  is  for  Zachary,  shutting  the  gate ; 

So    Good     Night,    little    children;    it's 
getting  quite  late.

THE    CHILD'S 


BOOK   OF    TRADES. 


THE    ARTIST. 


HERE  is  an  Artist  painting  a  picture. 
It  is  the  portrait  of  a  lady.  The 
picture  is  being  painted  upon  canvass, 
with  brushes  of  different  sizes  made 
from  the  hair  of  animals,  and  the  stand 
upon  which  the  picture  rests  is  called 
an  easel.  The  Artist  stands  near  the 
easel,  and  the  lady  is  seated  at  a 
little  distance  from  him.  Her  chair 
is  placed  on  a  dais  so  that  the  Artist 
may  have  a  full  view  of  her. 


I  hope  ma'am  you  take  care  to  sit 
still ;  for  if  you  do  not,  the  Artist  cannot 
make  your  picture  like,  and  he  looks  as 
if  he  was  trying  very  much. 

I  do  not  think  it  is  like  yet,  but  it 
looks  more  good-natured  and  smiling 
than  you  do.  You  look  rather  cross, 
which  is  a  pity. 

What  a  fine  dress  you  have  put  on ! 
The  feathers  are  very  grand,  and  you 
have  got  a  sort  of  goldeu  crown  besides. 
The  artist  has  not  done  it  well  at  all. 
He  has  not  put  points  enough,  and  the 
feathers  look  too  round  and  thick,  but 
they  are  not  done  yet,  and  he  will  make 
the  crown  right,  I  dare  say.  What 
large  red  bows  you  have  put  on  your 
blue  dress !  It  is  very  fine  indeed. 

The  artist  has  put  you  all  out  to  one 
side  in  the  picture.  I  wonder  what  he 
is  going  to  paint  in  that  empty  part. 
Perhaps  there  is  going  to  be  another 
grand  lady  sitting  by  you. 

What  bright  colours  the  artist  has 
got  on  his  palette !  That  flat  wooden 


thing  he  holds  in  his  hand  is  called  a 
palette,  and  that  is  his  brush  in  his 
other  hand  He  is  going  to  dip  his 
brush  in  the  red  paint.  I  suppose  lie 
is  going  to  do  the  bows,  or  perhaps  the 
red  chair. 


I  think  sir,  that  if  that  lion  was  alive 
you  would  not  go  so  near  him,  nor  peep 
into  his  cage  as  you  are  doing.  It  is 
only  a  stuffed  lion  in  a  glass  case. 
Take  care  you  do  not  break  the  glass 
with  your  umbrella. 


I  wonder  where  the  lion  came  from, 
and  where  he  lived  when  he  was  alive  ! 
He  is  a  very  large  lion !  What  a  great 
head  he  has  !  I  think  he  must  have 
come  from  Africa. 

We  cannot  see  wrhat  is  in  the  case 
hehind  the  gentleman.  We  can  just 
see  a  little  face  of  some  creature  in  that 
case  at  the  end  where  a  lady  and 
gentleman  are  standing.  I  think  it 
must  he  a  monkey.  But  it  must  he 
stuffed  too.  A  monkey  could  not  live 
in  a  glass  case  for  want  of  air  ;  and  if  it 
\vas  in  a  cage  you  could  not  venture  so 
near  it  as  the  lady  is,  unless  it  was  of 
some  very  gentle,  quiet  kind.  Monkeys 
are  so  full  of  tricks  and  mischief.  One 
day  a  lady  was  standing  near  a  cage  full 
of  them,  laughing  at  their  funny  ways, 
and  never  saw  that  one  of  them  was 
slowly  creeping  and  creeping  near  her, 
till  in  a  moment  it  darted  out  its  little 
black  hand,  seized  her  parasol  and 
climbed  up  to  the  top  of  the  cage  with 
it  and  broke  it  to  pieces. 


Were  you  ever  in  a  Blacksmith's 
Forge  ?  At  the  entrance  into  most 
villages,  the  Blacksmith  is  to  be  seen 
As  you  pass  you  hear  his  heavy  hammer 
banging  away,  and  the  fire  roaring  as 
another  man  or  boy  in  the  corner  blows 
the  bellows.  If  you  look  in,  you  see 
the  blacksmith  hammering  at  a  piece  of 
red-hot  iron,  and  the  sparks  fly  out  at 
every  stroke.  He  has  that  hoc  fire  to 
make  the  iron  red-hot,  and  do  you  know 
why  he  wants  his  iron  to  be  red-hot? 
It  is  because  then  it  is  soft,  and  he  can 
hammer  it  into  any  shape  he  likes. 
When  iron  is  cold  it  is  quite  hard. 

Another  day  you  may  see  the  black- 
smith shoeing  a  horse.  The  blacksmith 
makes  horse  shoes  of  iron,  and  as  each 
of  his  customers  wants  twro  pair,  he  has 
a  great  many  to  make.  You  may  see 
horse  shoes  hanging  on  the  wall  behind 
him,  ready  for  his  customers  when  they 
come.  Some  are  large,  for  cart  horses ; 
some  middle-sized  for  riding  horses ; 
some  little  for  ponies.  He  nails  them 


on  the  horse's  hoof.  It  does  not  hurt, 
hecause  the  hoof  is  hard  and  has  no 
feeling.  But  wild  horses  wear  no  shoes, 
and  some  people  think  they  are  better 
without  them,  at  least,  unless  they  have 
hard  work  on  stones  or  pavement. 


This  workman  is  called  an  Engineer. 
His  trade  is  to  make  all  manner  of 
great  engines  and  machines  that  are 
made  of  brass  and  iron.  Yon  have, 
I  dare  say,  sometimes  gone  by  a  rail- 
way train,  and  have  seen  the  engine 
that  goes  hissing  and  puffing  along, 
pulling  all  the  carriages  after  it.  These 
engines  are  made  by  engineers.  You 
may  see  in  the  picture,  some  of  the 
wheels  lying  on  the  floor,  and  a  tube  or 
great  pipe  that  is  to  be  some  part  of  an 
engine,  and  brass  chains,  and  bolts  and 
other  things. 

Perhaps,  some  day,  you  may  go  to 
see  a  factory  where  they  spin  cotton  or 
flax,  or  weave  calico  or  muslin.  These 
things  are  done  by  machines  that  can  do 
the  work  of  a  hundred  men  a  hundred 
times  faster  than  the  men  could.  All 
these  machines  are  made  by  engineers. 

In  England,  there  is  so  much  iron 
and  so  much  coal,  that  a  great  many 
machines  are  made  besides  those  used 
in  England  itself,  and  sent  to  other 


countries.  Do  you  know  what  the  coal 
is  for  ?  The  iron  could  not  be  got  out 
of  the  stone  it  is  found  in  without  great 
heat ;  and  then  it  is  so  hard,  that  till  it 
is  made  red-hot  in  the  fire  it  cannot  he 
made  into  anything  useful. 


I  think  that,  of  all  trades,  I  should 
like  best  to  be  a  Gardener.  How  nice 
it  is  to  work  among  pretty  flowers ;  and 
to  see  the  things  that  you  have  planted 
growing  up  from  little  weak  plants, 
and  throwing  out  leaves  and  buds  and 
bright  flowers.  This  gardener,  in  the 
picture,  seems  to  have  reared  a  great 
many  scarlet  geraniums.  I  think  he 
is  going  to  turn  one  out  of  the  pot  and 
put  it  in  the  ground.  The  little  tool 
he  holds  in  his  hand  is  called  a  trowel. 
He  will  dig  a  hole  in  the  ground  with 
it ;  then  he  will  get  the  plant  out  of  the 
pot  and  put  it  in.  There  it  will  grow 
to  be  very  large  and  throw  out  plenty  of 
flowers,  now  it  has  room  for  its  roots. 
But  then,  the  worst  of  it  is,  that  it 
cannot  bear  the  winter,  so  he  must 
take  it  up  before  the  frost  comes,  and 
in  doing  that,  he  may  kill  it.  The 
best  way  is  to  cut  off  some  of  its 
branches  early  in  autumn,  and  plant 
them  in  pots.  If  properly  trimmed 
and  cut,  all  the  branches,  or  slips,  as 


people  call  them,  will  take  root  and 
grow  into  plants,  and  he  will  keep  them 
in  warm  frames  or  houses  through  the 
winter,  and  in  spring  they  will  he  nice 
and  bushy,  and  if  he  has  saved  the  old 
root  too,  so  nmcli  the  better. 


Harvest  time  is  come,  and  the  corn 
is  ripe.  In  the  picture  you  see  a  field 
of  wheat,  gold  colour,  and  ready  for 
the  reaper,  and  the  reaper  is  there  with 
his  sickle  beginning  to  cut  it  down. 
You  may  know  wheat  from  other  kinds 


of  corn  by  its  standing  upright.  Barley 
droops  its  head  and  has  long  spines 
growing  hy  the  grains  that  people  call  its 
beard.  Oats  grow  light  and  feathery, 
like  some  of  the  wild  grasses. 

Bread  is  made  of  wheat.  The  farmer 
sows  it  in  his  fields,  and  it  springs  up 
and  ripens.  Then  the  reaper  cuts  it 
down.  By  and  bye,  it  is  thrashed, 
that  is,  beaten  to  get  the  grains  of 
wlieat  away  from  the  stalks,  which  are 
called  straw,  and  are  very  useful  too. 
Bonnets,  hats,  baskets,  mats,  and  many 
other  things  are  made  of  straw,  and 
cattle  and  horses  want  it  to  lie  upon 
for  beds.  When  the  grains  are  out  of 
the  straw  they  are  sent  to  the  miller  to 
grind  in  his  mill.  You  have  seen  a 
windmill,  I  dare  say,  and  perhaps  you 
have  seen  a  water-mill,  with  a  great 
wheel  turned  by  running  water  instead 
of  sails  turned  by  the  \vind ;  and  when 
the  miller  has  ground  the  wheat  into 
flour,  the  baker  buys  it  and  makes  the 
bread. 


If  you  have  ever  been  at  the  sea- 
side, you  must  have  seen  the  shrimps 
that  people  huy  for  breakfast,  or  if  you 
live  in  London  you  must  have  seen  the 
little  shrimps  in  the  shops.  This  man 
is  catching  them.  Shrimps  arc  little 


creatures  tliat  live  in  the  sand,  and  the 
time  to  catch  them  is  when  the  tide 
flows  over  the  sand,  and  the  water  is 
not  deeper  than  to  cover  the  man's 
feet,  for  then  they  jump  about  in  the 
water,  and  as  he  pushes  his  net  on 
before  him,  numbers  jump  into  it,  and 
he  takes  his  net  out  every  now  and 
then,  puts  the  shrimps  into  his  basket, 
and  goes  on  again  to  catch  more.  The 
poor  little  shrimps  soon  die  when  they 
are  out  of  the  water.  When  the 
shrimper  has  caught  enough,  he  takes 
them  to  the  fishmonger  and  sells  them 
to  him,  and  goes  home  and  gives  the 
money  to  his  wife  to  buy  food.  The 
fishmonger  boils  the  shrimps  and  sells 
them  to  whoever  will  buy.  Shrimps 
have  no  colour  till  they  are  boiled. 

Many  boys  are  shrimpers,  and  earn 
a  good  deal  by  it  to  help  their  fathers 
and  mothers.  The  work  is  not  too 
hard  for  them. 

Do  you  see  in  the  picture  the  boats 
in  the  sea,  and  the  sea-birds  flying  ? 


There  was  a  poor  widow  who  had  a 
little  boy.  He  never  could  learn  to 
read.  So  she  sent  him  to  the  farmer's, 
but  he  was  turned  off.  When  he 
grew  to  be  a  young  lad  he  never  got 
wages  like  the  others.  His  name  was 


Roger,  but  every  one  called  him  Hodge. 
One  summer,  the  poor  widow  fell  sick 
and  there  was  no  food  in  the  house. 
Hodge  sat  by  her  and  cried.  "  Don't 
cry,  dear!"  she  said,  "We  must  be 
patient."  "  Oh,  mother!"  sobbed  Hodge, 
"  You  want  your  cup  of  tea,  and  there's 
none  for  you." 

Hodge  got  up  at  daybreak  and  went 
out.  He  stood  about  till  the  farmer 
came  out  on  his  strong  horse.  Then  he 
wrent  up  to  the  farmer.  You  may  see  him 
in  the  picture.  "  Please  sir,  I  want  work 
in  the  hay,"  said  Hodge.  "Well,  my 
man,  I  want  hands,"  said  the  farmer,  "go 
and  begin !"  So  Hodge  worked  like  a 
lion.  Whenever  he  felt  lazy,  he  thought 
to  himself  "  mother's  cup  of  tea."  At 
night  he  got  half-a-crown  like  the  rest. 
He  went  to  the  shop,  bought  tea,  sugar, 
milk,  bread  and  butter ;  went  home, 
boiled  the  kettle,  and  helped  his  mother. 
She  never  liked  her  tea  so  much  before. 
She  was  so  happy  that  she  got  well,  and 
Hodge  was  less  lazy  always  after. 


What  a  strong  hoot  the  Cohhler  is 
mending !  I  think  he  will  make  it 
as  good  as  new.  lie  seems  to  have 
plenty  of  work.  I  have  seen  some 
cobblers  with  ten  or  more  pairs  of 
shoes  and  boots  lying  round  them  not 
touched,  and  the  people  kept  coming, 
and  saying,  "Are  my  boots  done  yet?*' 
"When  shall  I  have  my  shoes?" 
This  cobbler  looks  as  if  he  was  a  good 
worker. 

Do  you  know  that  it  was  a  poor  cob- 
bler that  first  began  a  ragged  school  ? 
His  name  was  John  Pounds.  As  he 
sat  at  work,  he  felt  very  sorry  to  see  a 
number  of  poor  ragged  children,  boys 
and  girls,  idling  about  in  the  street ; 
sometimes  fighting,  sometimes  doing 
mischief;  so  he  thought  he  would  try 
to  do  something  for  them.  He  called 
some  of  them  in,  and  began  to  talk  to 
them,  and  teach  them  what  he  knew, 
and  that  they  should  love  one  another 
and  not  fight,  and  that  they  should  try 
to  find  some  work  to  do  instead  of 


being  idle.  More  and  more  came  into 
his  little  shop,  and  he  got  easy  books 
and  taught  them  to  read,  and  taught 
them  to  say  little  hymns.  Now  there 
are  many  ragged  schools,  but  John 
Pounds  began  them. 


These  poor  Dressmakers  have  been 
at  work  since  eight  o'clock  in  the 
morning,  and  now  they  are  working  by 
candle-light,  late  at  night.  The  clock 
tells  the  hour.  It  is  nearly  ten  minutes 
past  twelve.  How  pale  and  tired  they 
look ! 

I  am  sure  that  if  the  fine  ladies  who 
are  going  to  wear  those  dresses  knew 
how  much  the  poor  girls  had  to  suffer., 
while  they  worked  at  them,  they  would 
be  very  sorry.  Perhaps  that  light  dress, 
all  trimmed  with  pink  ribbons  and  roses, 
is  for  a  young  lady  about  the  same  age 
as  the  young  girl  who  is  making  it. 
Perhaps  she  will  wear  it  at  a  ball,  and 
dance  gaily,  and  look  pretty  in  it.  She 
little  thinks  what  weary  fingers  fixed  on 
those  bright  ribbons  and  roses.  There 
are  many  kind  ladies  who  do  think  of 
it,  and  who  are  trying  to  prevent  it. 
They  tell  other  ladies  that  they  ought 
not  to  order  dresses  in  a  hurry,  nor  say 
"I  must  have  my  dress  to-morrow."  If 
they  do,  the  dressmakers  will  have  to 


sit  up  all  night  to  finish  the  work. 
And  these  kind  ladies  try  to  make  the 
mistresses  of  the  young  girls  think 
more  of  these  poor  workers,  and  air  the 
rooms  they  sit  in,  and  employ  more,  so 
as  to  prevent  any  working  so  long. 


This  man  is  a  Hatter.  Do  you  know 
what  hats  are  made  of?  When  you 
hear  the  people  calling  out  "'hare  skins T 
rabhit  skins !"  and  see  the  cooks  come 
out  to  sell  them,  you  have  heard  one  of 
the  things  hats  are  made  of.  Rabbit 
skins  help  very  much  in  making  hats. 

Rabbit  skins  are  of  use  for  many 
other  things,  but  they  are  very  much 
used  for  hats.  The  hair  is  felted  as  it 
is  called,  that  is,  made  into  a  close  soft 
stuff  like  cloth,  and  made  into  the 
shape  the  hatter  wants.  Then  it  is  a 
felt  hat  as  it  is  called,  and  many  hats 
are  worn  so.  All  those  soft  hats  that 
people  call  wide-awakes  are  made  of 
the  felt,  without  any  more  being  done 
to  them.  There  is  one  lying  on  a  chair 
with  a  bright  red  lining  in  it.  But  if 
the  hatter  wants  to  make  a  bright,  stiff 
hat,  such  as  gentlemen  wear,  he  puts 
silk  outside  it  that  is  made  fit  for  his 
purpose.  They  used  to  put  the  hair  of 
the  beaver,  but  it  is  little  used  now. 
He  is  at  work  on  a  hat  now,  putting  on 


the  silk.  Those  two  that  look  white, 
and  are  near  him,  he  has  done,  and  has 
put  silver  paper  over  them  for  fear  they 
should  be  spoiled.  All  about  the  table 
you  see  his  tools,  and  on  the  floor 
many  boxes  to  put  the  hats  in. 


"  Knives  to  grind !  Scissors  to  grind !" 
We  have  all  heard  this  cry  in  the 
streets.  Here  you  may  see  a  Knife- 
grinder  at  work.  The  sort  of  little  cart 
or  barrow  he  nses  is  made  so  as  to 
turn  a  grindstone  when,  he  works  a 
wheel  with  his  foot.  It  is  the  grind- 
stone that  sharpens  the  knives  and 
scissors.  If  you  look,  you  wrill  see  how 
he  holds  the  knife  so  as  to  make  the 
stone  grind  it.  He  must  do  it  with 
care,  or  else  he  will  grind  away  the 
steel  too  much.  If  he  is  a  good 
workman  he  will  only  sharpen  the  edge 
and  not  wear  away  more  than  he  can 
help.  If  you  are  near  him,  you  will 
hear  the  stone  go  hissing  against  the 
steel  knife,  and  will  see  sparks  fly  out. 
The  stone  and  the  steel  coming  to- 
gether so  fast,  strike  out  sparks.  In 
the  same  way  you  may  see  a  horse, 
when  it  gallops  along  a  stony  road, 
strike  out  sparks  as  his  iron  shoes  dasli 
among  the  stones. 

The  knife-grinder  smokes  a  pipe  as 


he  works.  In  winter,  it  is  rather  cold 
work  for  him,  so  I  suppose  he  finds  his 
pipe  a  comfort,  though  I  should  not 
myself.  I  think  the  smell  is  anything 
hut  nice.  But  the  knife-grinder  likes 
it,  and  it  is  his  affair,  and  not  mine. 


"  There  is  the  Postman's  knock  !  I 
wonder  whether  he  has  brought  the 
letter !"  It  was  little  Amy  that  said  this. 
She  had  heard  that  some  day  a  letter 
wras  coming  from  grandmamma,  that 
was  to  ask  her  to  go  to  see  her,  so  Amy 


hoped  every  day  the  letter  would  come. 
She  looked  out  at  the  window.  Yes, 
there  was  the  postman.  Then  Amy 
went  out  of  the  school-room  and  stood 
on  the  stairs  to  see  where  the  letter  was 
taken  to.  Susan  went  to  the  drawing- 
room  with  it. 

In  a  little  while  the  door  opened,  and 
mamma  came  in.  There  was  an  open 
letter  in  her  hand.  "  O  mamma  !  is  it 
from  grandmamma  ?"  cried  Amy,  start- 
ing up.  "  It  is  from  grandmamma?" 
and  she  wants  my  little  Amy  to  go 
to-morrow  to  stay  for  a  week  !"  "  O 
mamma,  I  am  so  glad,"  cries  Amy, 
44  only  I  wish  you  were  going  too." 
44 1  am  going  too,"  said  mamma.  Amy 
jumped  up  into  mamma's  arms  with 
one  hound,  and  clung  round  her  neck. 

Now  there  was  no  more  thought  of 
lessons  that  day.  The  boxes  had  to  be 
packed,  and  she  had  to  go  and  see  her 
little  cousins,  and  say  good  bye,  and 
many  things  to  do.  Next  morning  they 
set  out  and  were  so  happy. 


Did  you  ever  think  where  all  the 
stones  come  from  that  are  used  for 
building  bridges  and  churches,  and 
paving  streets,  in  England?  and  in 
Scotland,  for  building  houses  ?  for  in 
Scotland  they  hardly  ever  use  bricks  for 


houses ;  nothing  hut  stone.  All  this 
stone  is  found  in  the  earth,  and  has  to 
be  got  out ;  and  the  places  where  there 
is  plenty  of  good  stone  to  be  found, 
and  where  people  have  worked  to  get 
it,  and  go  on  getting  it  out  are  called 
quarries. 

Now  you  must  think  it  is  not  very 
easy  to  bring  the  hard  stone  out  of  the 
earth.  Men  work  at  it  with  pickaxes, 
but  it  would  take  a  long  time  to  get 
much  in  that  way,  so  they  begin  with 
blowing  it  up  with  gunpowder.  They 
bore  a  hole  in  the  stone  or  rock. 
Into  the  hole  they  pour  some  gun- 
powder. Then  they  get  what  is  called 
a  slow  match,  that  will  go  on  slowly 
burning.  This  they  put  into  the  hole 
and  light  the  end.  Then  they  get  out 
of  the  way  to  a  safe  distance,  and  by 
and  bye  the  gunpowder  takes  fire  and 
blows  up  many  pieces  of  rock  with  a 
great  noise.  In  the  picture  you  may 
see  a  lighted  match,  and  men  hiding 
down  at  the  bottom  of  the  quarry. 


There  was  a  poor  old  man  who  lived 
with  his  wife  in  a  village.  They  had 
worked  hard  all  their  lives,  but  they 
had  such  small  wrages  that  they  could 
not  save  any  money,  and  now  they 
were  old  and  could  not  work,  nor 


pay  their  rent.  None  of  their  children 
could  help  them.  Their  eldest  son 
went  many  years  ago  to  a  far  country. 
The  next  went  for  a  soldier  and  was 
killed.  The  third  died  of  a  fever. 
Their  daughters  were  all  poor.  They 
could  not  bear  to  go  to  the  workhouse. 
It  is  very  hard  to  work  all  your  life, 
and  at  last  to  go  there,  where  the  old 
man  would  be  put  among  the  men,  and 
the  old  woman  among  the  women. 
They  had  lived  together  for  forty  years. 
It  would  be  very  dreadful  for  them. 

So  the  old  man  thought  he  would 
try  to  earn  some  money  as  a  tinker. 
He  knew  how  to  mend  pots  and  kettles. 
They  sold  what  few  things  they  had, 
and  he  bought  an  iron  pot  for  his  fire, 
and  some  tools,  and  they  went  away 
together,  and  in  every  town  and  village 
he  lighted  his  fire,  and  people  gave  him 
their  old  things  to  mend.  I  hope  he 
will  get  work,  and  that  he  and  his  poor 

old  wife  may  be  able  to  live  and 

•/ 

go  to  the  workhouse. 


These  two  ladies  have  come  to  see 
the  old  church.  It  is  a  fine  old  church, 
and  has  painted  windows  and  old 
tombs,  and  the  man  is  telling  them 
whose  tomb  that  is.  Some  Knight 
that  died  a  great  many  years  ago. 


Then  they  went  on  to  other  parts  of 
the  church,  and  they  went  out  into  the 
churchyard,  where  there  were  many 
tomhstones,  and  walked  about  among 

them.     There  they  saw  an  old  woman 

«' 

shading  her  eyes  from  the  sun,  and 
calling  "Lizzie,  Lizzie!"  She  said 
that  her  little  grandchild  had  gone  out 
with  the  kitten  and  her  doll,  and  could 
not  he  found  anywhere.  The  ladies 
helped  her  to  look,  but  it  was  of  no 
use.  At  last  they  went  back  into  the 
church  to  rest,  and  while  they  were 
there,  they  heard  a  little  voice  say, 
"  Sit  still,  pussy."  They  looked  round. 
"'Hold  up  your  head,  dolly  T'  said  the 
voice  again.  They  looked  down  into 
one  of  the  pews  and  there  they  saw  a 
little  girl  sitting  on  the  floor  with  a 
kitten  and  a  doll  on  a  stool  in  front  of 
her.  "  Ah,  little  Lizzie  !  Granny  wants 
you,"  they  said.  So  Lizzie  let  one  of 
them  carry  her,  and  the  other  carry 
pussy  and  dolly,  and  they  went  out  and 
soon  found  Granny. 


LITTLE     STORIES 


FOR 


GOOD    CHILDREN. 


LUCY  AND  HER  DOLL. 


HERE  are  some  nice  short  tales  for 
you,  easy  to  read.  They  are  called 
"Little  Stories  for  Good  Children." 
They  are  all  about  little  boys  and  girls, 
and  their  friends,  and  their  playthings. 
There  is  a  story  about  a  little  boy  who 
was  a  sailor  and  went  to  sea ;  and  one 
about  a  little  girl  who  went  to  a  party ; 
and  another  about  a  bad  boy  who  was 
idle  at  school ;  and  many  more.  We 
will  begin  with  the  Story  of  Lucy  and 
her  Doll. 


There  were  two  little  girls,  Lucy  and 
Fanny.  Lucy  was  the  eldest ;  she  was 
ten  ;  Fanny  was  eight.  Lucy  went  to 
school,  but  Fanny  stayed  at  home. 
When  she  wras  ten,  she  was  to  go  to 
school  too. 

The  holidays  were  near.  How  Fanny 
longed  for  Lucy  to  come.  Four  weeks 
before,  she  began  counting  the  days 
that  had  to  pass.  Then  she  began  to 
think  that  she  should  like  to  give  Lucy 
something.  What  could  she  give  her  ? 
Suppose  she  gave  her  the  doll  that  was 
bought  with  the  money  Aunt  Jane 
sent  at  Christmas.  She  ran  to  the 
drawer  to  look  at  it.  There  lay  the 
doll  wrapped  in  silver  paper.  It  had 
long,  curling,  golden  hair  and  black 
eyes  ;  pretty  hands,  and  arms  and  feet, 
but  no  clothes.  Fanny  wrent  to  her 
mamma,  and  asked  her  if  she  had  a 
piece  of  silk  to  make  it  a  frock ;  so 
her  mamma  found  a  pretty  piece  of 
green  silk,  and  some  crimson  ribbons 
for  bows.  But,  besides  a  frock,  her 


mamma  said  she  must  make  under- 
clothes, and  she  gave  her  white  calico 
for  them,  and  a  pretty  little  pair  of 
shoes.  There  you  can  see  Fanny,  when 
she  had  dressed  the  doll,  giving  it  a 
walk  up  and  down  the  room. 


What  a  pity  this  boy  has  found  the 
bird's  nest ;  poor  little  birds  !  They 
would  have  lived  to  be  so  happy.  They 
would  have  learned  of  their  parents 
how  to  Hy  through  the  air  among  the 
green  leaves,  and  sing  and  enjoy  their 
lives.  Now  they  will  all  be  dead  in  a 
very  little  while.  A  cruel  boy  can  take 
away  life  in  a  moment,  but  all  the  men 
in  the  world  cannot  give  it  again ;  no, 
not  all  the  greatest  and  strongest  men 
that  ever  lived.  Boys  do  not  think 
what  they  do  when  they  give  pain,  and 
take  away  life. 

I  daresay  the  mother  and  father  birds 
are  up  in  the  tree,  looking  down  at 
their  poor  little  ones  and  mourning. 
They  made  the  nest  with  care :  it  is 
made  of  little  twigs  of  wood,  woven 
together,  and  lined  with  soft,  green 
moss,  and  wool  that  a  sheep  had  left 
on  a  furze-bush  ;  and  horse-hair,  that 
a  poney  had  dropped  out  of  his  tail  as 
he  whisked  it  about  to  drive  away  the 
flies.  They  built  it  in  a  forked  branch 


of  that  tree  ;  then  the  hen-bird  laid 
six  pretty  little  blue  eggs  in  it ;  then 
she  sat  on  them  till  they  were  hatched  j 
and,  after  that,  she  and  her  mate  flew 
about  and  found  food  for  them.  Now 
it  is  all  over.  Poor  little  birds  ! 


There  was  a  little   girl  called  Jessie, 
who   had    an    aunt,   who    lived    in  the 

country,  and  Jessie  went  to  stay  a  week 

•/  * 

with  her.  It  wras  dark  when  the  train 
stopped,  and  Jessie's  aunt  was  there 
and  took  her  to  the  house  ;  and  Jessie 
went  to  bed,  in  a  nice  little  room,  and 
was  asleep  in  a  minute.  Next  morn- 
ing, she  opened  her  eyes  and  could  not 
think,  at  first,  where  she  was ;  then  she 
heard  the  sweetest  sounds,  as  if  her 
canary  had  come  too,  and  brought  a 
number  of  friends  with  him.  It  was 
birds  outside  the  window  that  she  heard. 
She  jumped  up,  and  peeped  out  at  the 
side  of  the  blind.  It  was  so  lovely;  in- 
stead of  houses  to  look  at,  there  were 
green  fields  with  trees  in  them,  outside 
the  garden  ;  and  close  by,  under  her 
window,  was  the  garden  full  of  bright 
flowers.  The  flowers  and  their  green 
leaves  were  glancing  in  the  sun,  for 
they  were  covered  with  dew-drops,  and 
so  was  the  grass  plot  in  the  middle  of 
the  garden.  She  opened  the  window 


a 


to  hear  the  birds  better ;  and  how  sweet 
the  air  was !  She  made  haste  to  dress, 
that  she  might  go  out.  She  spent 
happy  week  ;  and,  when  she  went  back, 
her  aunt  let  her  pick  a  large  nosegay, 
to  take  to  her  papa  and  mamma. 


Whit-Monday  was  come,  and  so  Mr. 
and  Mrs.  Wood  had  written  to  their 
two  sons,  in  London,  that  they  hoped 
they  would,  come  down  by  the  train 
and  spend  the  holiday  at  home.  Mr. 
Wood  was  a  carpenter  in  a  country 
village,  and  had  a  very  pretty  cottage. 
It  stood  in  a  green  lane,  with'  fields 
and  trees  all  round  ;  there  was  a  pear- 
tree  at  one  end,  trained  on  the  wrall ; 
the  door  had  a  porch  covered  with 
honey-suckle ;  in  front  was  a'  little 
garden  full  of  flowers. 

Think  what  a  pleasure  it  was  for 
John  and  Thomas,  who  were  working 
at  trades  in  smoky  London,  to  come 
there. 

Jane  and  Martha,  their  two  sisters, 
were  busy  getting  ready  for  them 
all  the  week  before.  The  parlour  was 
cleaned,  the  windows  made  as  bright 
as  diamonds  ;  the  bedroom  they  were 
to  have  was  scrubbed,  and  made  fresh 
and  sweet ,  for  they  were  to  stay  all 
night,  indeed  they  hoped  two  nights. 


Then  began  the  cooking :  look  what  a 
large  gooseberry  pie  Martha  has  made. 
What  a  pleasure   it  was  to  meet  at 
the    station,   and    all    come    home    to- 
gether;   and  to  sit  in  the  evening 
the  porch,  and  tell  all  the  news.

It  was  past  Willy's  bedtime,  and  his 
mamma  had  told  him  to  go,  but  he 
would  not  go.  "  I  do  not  want  to  go 
to  bed  ;  I  will  not  go  to  bed."  This 
wTas  the  way  he  went  on.  Then  he 
began  to  cry,  and  leaned  against  the 


door.  His  mamma  was  sitting  out  in 
the  garden  by  moonlight :  she  was  very 
sorry  to  see  her  little  boy  so  naughty. 

After  waiting  a  good  while  she  went 
in  and  shut  the  door.  Willy  wras 
making  such  a  noise  that  he  did  not 
hear  her  go  :  at  last  he  looked  up.  He 
was  alone  in  the  garden.  The  moon 
shone  bright,  but  he  could  not  see  his 
mamma  near. 

"  Mamma,  mamma!"  he  called  out; 
" 1  will  go  to  bed  now."  Then  he  went 
to  the  door  and  beat  it ;  but  no  one 
came.  At  last  he  felt  what  a  foolish 
boy  he  was !  and  how  wrrong  he  had 
been  not  to  obey  his  mamma.  "  Come 
to  me,  mamma!"  he  began  to  say. 
He  was  crying,  but  with  sorrow,  not 
passion.  He  tapped  gently  at  the 
door.  Then  his  mamma  opened  it, 
and  let  him  in.  She  did  not  speak 
to  him,  but  led  him  up  and  put  him 
into  bed  :  she  gave  him  a  kiss ;  and  he 
said,  "  Mamma,  I  am  very  sorry  I  was 
so  naughty." 


George,  Emmy,  Arthur,  and  little 
Freddy  played  at  soldiers.  Jane  had 
helped  to  dress  them  up,  and  stayed  to 
look  at  them.  George  was  the  captain. 
He  had  put  on  a  paper  cocked  hat,  and 
had  a  sword  by  his  side ;  in  one  hand 


he  held  a  gun,  in  the  other  a  stick,  to 
wave  about. 

Emmy  was  Serjeant.  She  had  a  tall 
blue  cap  on,  and  carried  a  gun,  and 
had  red  shoes  to  look  as  red  as  she 
could.  Arthur  was  the  drummer.  He 
kept  on  drumming  and  making  such  a 
noise,  that  Emmy  told  him  she  could 
not  hear  the  Captain's  orders,  and  he 
must  stop.  Little  Freddy  was  a  com- 
mon soldier.  They  had  not  a  gun  for 
him,  so  he  was  to  pretend  he  had  one, 
and  to  be  sure  to  march  about  after  the 
others. 

They  marched  round  and  round  the 
room.  The  drummer  made  a  very  great 
drumming  and  noise,  and  the  captain 
and  serjeant  fired  off  their  guns  very 
often,  always  calling  out  "Bang!"  when 
they  had  taken  aim  ;  and  Freddy  called 
"  bang,"  too,  though  he  had  no  gun. 
After  a  great  deal  of  noise  and  shouting, 
the  review  was  over  ;  the  drum  beat 
very  loud,  and  they  marched  round 
again,  and  that  ended  the  game. 


Almost  all  boys  and  girls  have  a 
Christmas  Tree  now  on  Christmas  Eve. 
Here  are  a  number  enjoying  them- 
selves, and  looking  at  all  the  bright 
presents  hanging  on  the  tree.  Would 
you  like  to  know  their  names  ? 


The  tall  young  lady,  with  a  yellow 
frock  and  blue  sash,  is  Rose ;  she  is  at 
home,  and  is  giving  the  party.  The 
little  boy  she  holds  by  his  hand  is  her 
cousin  Charley.  It  is  the  first  time  he 
has  ever  been  out  at  a  party,  for  he 
is  only  five  ;  and  he  never  saw  a 
Christmas  tree  before,  and  thinks  it  so 
very  grand. 

The  boy  and  girl  on  Rose's  left 
hand,  are  Frank  and  Lizzie  ;  they  live 
next  door  and  have  come  to  spend 
Christinas  Eve  with  Rose.  The  boy 
in  a  blue  jacket,  red  waistcoat,  and 
white  trousers,  is  named  Fred ;  and 
that  is  his  sister  Jane  behind  him. 
They  have  just  come  in,  and  Rose  is 
turning  round  to  say,  "  How  d'ye  do, 
Fred?"  in  her  pretty  manner.  More 
boys  and  girls  will  come  soon.  They 
will  have  tea  and  cake ;  then  they  will 
play  games ;  and,  after  that,  the  pre- 
sents will  be  taken  off  the  Christmas 
tree,  and  something  given  to  each. 
Then  they  will  go  home. 


Mary  expects  her  mamma  home  to- 
day, and  runs  out  to  the  door,  every 
now  and  then,  to  see  if  she  can  see 
her  coming.  Her  mamma  has  been 
away  in  London  for  a  whole  week,  ancl 
Mary  wants  her  back  very  much  in- 


deed  ;  it  seems  so  very  long  since  she 
went.  Mary  has  been  in  the  garden 
to  gather  some  fresh  roses,  and  other 
pretty  flowers,  to  put  in  water  and 
place  on  her  mamma's  table,  that  the 
room  may  be  sweet  and  bright  when 
she  comes  ;  and,  before  she  goes  in,  she 
stops  and  listens  in  hopes  of  hearing 
her  mamma's  footstep  on  the  walk. 
She  has  tried  to  make  the  garden  look 
very  nice  too.  She  has  picked  off  all 
the  husks  of  the  roses  that  had  blown 
and  shed  their  sweet  leaves ;  and  she 
has  picked  any  dead  leaves  off  the 
other  flowers,  and  pulled  up  any  weeds 
she  could  see,  and  smoothed  the  bor- 
ders with  her  little  rake  :  and  all  the 
time  her  mamma  was  away,  she  has 
taken  care  of  the  plants  in  pots,  and 
has  watered  them  every  day  with  her 
little  watering-pot :  and  she  has  cleaned 
the  canary's  cage  every  morning,  and 
fed  him  with  his  seed,  and  put  fresh 
water  for  him  in  his  bath  and  his 
drinking-glass. 


Little  Emmy  and  her  mamma  were 
going  home  one  winter's  day.  It  was 
only  four  o'clock,  but  it  was  growing 
dark  in  the  London  streets,  and  the 
Lamp-lighters  wrere  lighting  the  gas 
lamps.  "  Papa  w^ill  be  home  first  if  we 
do  not  wralk  fast,"  said  Emmy's  mamma, 
So  they  walked  fast.  Emmy  thought 
of  nice  home,  of  the  bright  fire  in  the 
dining-room,  of  going  in  after  dinner 
and  sitting  on  papa's  knee  and  his 
telling  her  a  story,  and  danced  along, 
holding  by  her  mamma's  hand. 

Just  then,  there  wras  a  sad  sound 
near  them.  "  O  mammy,  mammy  !" 
They  stopped,  and  saw,  running  by 
their  side,  a  poor  little  ragged  girl, 
crying,  and  Emmy's  mamma  said, 
"What  makes  you  cry  dear?"  "I 
want  mammy  !"  sobbed  the  poor  child. 
"  And  where  is  she  ?"  "  At  home,  and 
I  can't  find  the  way.  I  am  lost !" 

Emmy  was  crying  now.  ' '  O  mamma ! ' ' 
she  said,  "how  dreadful  it  must  be  to  be 
lost !  Let  us  take  her  home."  So  they 


led  her  home  ,  and  gave  her  bread  and 
milk  for  supper,  and  nurse  washed  her, 
and  Emmy  lent  her  a  little  night  gown, 
and  she  was  put  in  a  nice  bed.  Next 
day  they  found  out  her  home,  and  her 
mother  was  so  happy  to  see  her  again. 


There  was  a  Milkmaid,  that  lived  at 
a  farm  house.  She  had  to  take  care  of 
six  cows,  and  make  butter  and  cheese. 
Her  name  was  Dolly.  It  was  summer, 
and  the  cows  stayed  out  all  night 

There  was  Jetty,  who  was  black  and 
white ;  Spot,  wras  brown  and  white ; 
Brownie,  was  all  brown.  Then  there 
were  three  small  cows,  mouse  colour 
and  white,  that  came  from  Guernsey, 
and  their  names  were  Maggie,  Pet  and 
Darling. 

Dolly  used  to  open  the  gate  of  the 
field,  and  set  down  her  pails  with  a 
clang  to  make  the  cows  hear.  Then 
Pet  was  sure  to  stop  eating  and  look  at 
her.  Pet  was  always  the  first  to  coifte 
to  be  milked.  Her  milk  was  so-  rich  it 
was  like  cream,  and  there  was  one  little 
pail  called  "  Pet's  pail,"  for  her  milk 
alone.  Darling  came  next,  and  she  had 
a  pail  of  her  own  too.  Then  came 
Maggie.  She  was  young  and  foolish, 
and  would  kick  while  she  wras  being 
milked.  One  morning  she  kicked  over 


the  pails  and  spilt  all  the  milk.     It  was 
very  sad. 

Jetty,  Brownie,  and  Spot,  wanted  a 
great  deal  of  calling.  There  you  see 
Dolly  with  her  pails  going  hack  to  the 
dairy. 


"  Welcome  home,  sailor  boy!    Where 
do  you  come  from?" 

"  I  have  been  a  voyage  to  Bordeaux, 
in  France,  in  the    good  ship   LIVELY 
NANCY.    We  sailed  from  London,  and 
steered  down  the  river  Thames  ;  and  we 
saw  the  North  Foreland  Lighthouse,  and 
came  into  the  Downs,  and  got  into  the 
British  Channel.     Then  wre  steered  to 
the  southward,  and  at  last  we  got  to 
Bordeaux.     We    had    brought  flannels 
to  keep  the  French  people  warm,  and 
blankets  for  their  beds,  and  broadcloth 
for  their    coats,  and   tweeds  to    make 
trousers  for  them.     So,  when  we  were 
clear,  we  loaded  again  with  silks   for 
the  ladies  in  England,  and  wine  for  the 
gentlemen.    Then  we  sailed  homeward. 
I  was  glad  to  see   the  white   cliffs   of 
old  England  again.     I  climbed  to  the 
topmast   this   morning,   at    sunrise,   to 
get   the    first    sight    of  them.      When 
we   got  off  Sussex,  the  Captain  says : 
*  Jack !   what  would  you  say  if  I  put 
you  ashore  in  the  boat  ?     You  are  nigk 


your  home  here.'  I  jumped  for  joy, 
and  got  my  bundle.  That's  father's 
cottage  on  the  cliff.  Hurrah  !  there's 
mother  coming  to  meet  me,  with  Dick 
and  Polly.  Good  bye,  little  gentlemen 
and  ladies." 


The  poor  man  that  you  see  making 
the  basket  is  quite  blind.  Blind  people 
can  be  taught  to  do  many  things  ;  they 
can  make  baskets,  and  mats,  and 
brushes,  and  several  things.  There  are 
schools  where  they  are  taught;  and  they 


can  learn  to  read,  too.  Tlie  books  they 
use  have  letters  that  are  raised,  so  that 
they  can  feel  them  ;  they  feel  about 
with  their  fingers,  and  find  out  by  the 
shape  what  letter  it  is. 

The  girl  you  see  at  work,  at  a  neat 
little  basket,  is  the  blind  man's  daughter. 
Her  name  is  Sally;  she  helps  him,  if 
he  wants  help ;  and  she  makes  the 
baskets  that  are  smaller  and  prettier. 
Then,  when  they  have  made  a  good 
many,  they  bring  out  a  little  cart  that 
they  have,  and  their  donkey  that  feeds 
on  the  common,  and  they  load  this  cart 
with  baskets  and  mats,  and  all  they 
have  made,  and  go  about  and  sell 
them.  Sally  leads  her  father  by  the 
hand,  because  he  cannot  see  to  guide 
himself ;  and  makes  the  donkey  go  the 
right  way.  Then,  when  they  have  been 
out  all  day,  they  count  their  money 
and  see  how  much  they  have  made. 
Sally  puts  away  Eighteen-pence,  to  pay 
the  rent,  and  they  buy  all  they  want 
with  the  rest. 


Here  is  the  Omnibus  just  starting 
from  a  London  street  to  some  country 
place ;  perhaps  it  is  going  to  llamp- 
stead.  At  one  of  the  windows  a  news- 
boy is  holding  up  a  paper,  calling  out 
its  name  ;  he  wants  some  one  to  buy  it. 


"  Only  a  penny/'  he  calls  out.  No  one 
seems  to  hear,  or  to  intend  to  buy; 
hut  I  daresay,  before  the  omnibus  starts, 
some  one  will  put  his  hand  in  his 
waistcoat  pocket,  and  find  a  penny 
and  buy  of  the  boy. 

I  wonder  if  the  lady  and  gentleman 
coming  along  want  to  get  into  the 
omnibus.  There  is  hardly  room  inside, 
I  fear.  The  gentleman  can  go  on  the 
top,  but  what  will  the  lady  do  ? 
Perhaps  one  of  those  gentlemen  who 
are  sitting  there  will  give  her  his  place, 
and  go  outside.  I  have  often  seen 
gentlemen  do  so.  When  it  is  fine  it 
must  be  pleasant  on  the  top,  though 
a  lady  would  not  like  to  go  there, 
and  it  would  not  be  easy  for  her  to 
climb  up  or  get  down,  though  a  gentle- 
man does  not  mind.  But  when  it  is 
raining,  or  very  cold,  it  is  best  to  be 
inside,  and  then  it  is  very  kind  of  a 
gentleman  to  give  up  his  seat.  Well, 
wre  should  all  try  to  be  kind  to  each 
other. 


This  Organ-man  has  gone  into  the 
country ;  he  has  gone  inside  a  gate, 
into  a  pretty  garden,  and  is  playing 
there,  and  some  boys  outside  are 
standing  to  listen.  Most  likely  there 
is  a  house  in  the  garden. 


I  once  knew  a  little  girl  who  lived 
in  the  country,  and  who  used  to  like 
to  hear  an  organ  very  much.  There 
was  one  organ-man  that  came  every 
week  to  play  to  her ;  she  called  him 
66  my  organ-mail,"  When  she  heard 
him  coming  up  the  lane,  playing  as 
he  came,  to  tell  her  he  w^as  coming, 
she  used  to  jump  up  from  her  play,  or 
her  work,  or  whatever  she  was  doing, 
and  run  for  her  hat.  Then  she  used 
to  open  the  house  door,  and  the  garden 
door,  and  go  out  into  the  Jane.  It  was 
very  quiet  there,  with  a  pretty  green 
field  and  trees,  facing  the  garden  gate 
on  the  other  side.  Then  the  organ- 
man  used  to  stand  under  a  tree  and 
play,  and  she  danced  to  the  music. 
Hound  and  round  she  went  so  prettily 
and  merrily,  holding  up  her  arms  in 
the  joy  of  her  heart.  The  organ-man 
looked  so  pleased  to  see  her.  When 
he  had  done,  she  ran  in  and  got  two- 
pence for  him,  and  often  gave  him 
some  milk  and  cake. 


The  holidays  were  come,  and  little 
Fanny,  who  lived  at  home,  had  had  the 
joy  of  seeing  her  dear  sister  Lucy  come 
from  school,  and  had  given  her  a  pretty 
new  doll  that  she  had  dressed  herself . 
Lucy  liked  it  very  much,  and  named 
it  Sylvia.  Lucy  had  a  great  many  stories 
to  tell  to  Fanny  about  her  schoolfel- 
lows, and  the  games  they  played,  and 
the  lessons  they  did ;  and  Fanny  had 
to  tell  Lucy  about  home,  about  the 
garden,  and  the  ducks  and  the  chickens, 
and  all  manner  of  things. 

Aunt  Jane  was  going  to  give  a  dance. 
Lucy  was  to  go,  but  Fanny  was  too 
young ;  so  she  helped  to  dress  Lucy, 
and  Lucy  promised  to  tell  her  all  about 
it  next  day. 

Lucy  had  a  new  frock  to  go  in ;  it 
was  blue,  trimmed  with  red,  and  had 
pretty  white  lace  in  the  sleeves.  She 
had  white  shoes  with  red  bows,  and 
a  red  rose  in  her  hair,  and  a  red  sash 
with  a  very  large  bow  behind  ;  in  one 
hand  she  held  a  fan,  and  in  the  other 


a  bouquet  of  lovely  flowers.  Fanny 
thought  she  looked  very  pretty.  When 
Lucy  was  gone,  little  Fanny  went  to 
bed,  and  dreamed  that  she  went  to  the 
dance,  and  saw  Lucy  dancing  and  look- 
ing prettier  than  any  one. 


How  very  foolish  it  is  of  boys  to  be 
idle  when  they  are  sent  to  school ! 
They  are  sent  there  for  their  own  good. 
It  does  not  matter  to  any  one  else  half 
so  much  as  to  themselves,  whether  they 
learn  anything  or  not ;  if  they  grow 
up  poor  dunces,  that  cannot  read  or 
write,  the  loss  will  be  all  their  own. 
Other  boys  will  be  able  to  read  nice 
books,  and  write  letters  to  their  friends, 
if  they  go  away  to  some  distant  country, 
and  read  the  letters  their  friends  send 
to  them ;  but  the  poor  dunces  can  do 
none  of  these  things.  And  now,  only 
think  how  many  young  men  go  to 
other  countries  to  get  work,  and  get 
better  wages,  and  get  on  better  than 
if  they  had  stayed  at  home  ;  but  how 
sad  it  must  be  for  them  if  they  cannot 
read  or  write  !  They  can  never  get 
any  news  of  the  friends  they  have  left 
at  home,  while  those  who  can  write, 
have  sent  letters  home  with  money  in 
them,  to  bring  their  dear  fathers  and 
mothers,  brothers  and  sisters,  out,  and 


been  as  happy  together  as  they  could 
be.  Now  look  at  that  foolish  boy  stand- 
ing on  a  stool  at  the  school-room  door, 
while  all  the  others  are  at  play ;  he  will 
not  learn,  so  there  he  is  with  a  dunce's 
cap  on.  Poor,  foolish  fellow ! 


Jack  was  a  sailor  boy,  and  had  come 
home  from  sea  after  a  voyage  ;  and 
while  he  was  at  home,  he  wras  fond  of 
roaming  about  with  his  little  sister 
Polly.  They  lived  near  the  sea;  but 
what  Jack  liked  best  was  to  get  into 
the  woods,  and  there  were  very  pretty 
woods  near  their  father's  cottage.  Jack 
used  to  climb  the  trees  ;  he  got  up  to 
the  top  of  the  highest  trees  in  no  time. 
There  he  used  to  find  squirrels'  nests 
and  birds'  nests,  and  he  would  have 
taken  them,  only  Polly  would  not  let 
him.  Polly  went  to  school,  and  to 
Sunday-school ;  and  the  lady  that  came 
to  teach  them  on  Sundays  had  told  the 
children  how  squirrels  live  in  the  trees, 
and  collect  a  little  store  of  acorns,  and 
nuts,  and  fir-cones,  for  hard  weather ; 
and  how  little  birds  build  nests  with 
such  skill,  and  rear  their  little  ones ; 
so  Polly  loved  all  these  creatures,  and 
could  not  bear  to  see  anybody  do  them 
harm.  She  used  to  get  Jack  to  sit 
down  on  the  moss,  at  the  foot  of  the 


tree,  when  he  came  down,  and  tell  him 
stories  about  wild  creatures  that  her 
teacher  had  told  to  her. 

Then  they  used  to  walk  about  hand 
in  hand,  and  she  picked  the  pretty 
flowers  and  told  Jack  their  names. 


Jane  and  her  sister  Emily  had  a 
party  of  their  young  friends  to  come 
to  see  them,  and  took  them  to  see  all 
the  pretty  places  near.  One  day  they 
made  a  plan  to  go  to  a  hill  where  there 
was  a  fine  view,  and  to  have  tea  there. 
So  their  mamma  ordered  out  the 
carriage.  Under  the  coachman's  seat 
was  a  hamper,  packed  with  good  things. 
But,  when  all  had  got  ready,  it  was 
found  that  two  were  left  without  seats. 

"  I  will  tell  you  what  w^e  will  do," 
said  Jane.  "  Let  John  saddle  the 
donkey,  and  lead  him  a  little  w^ay,  till 
we  see  that  he  will  be  good  and  go  on, 
and  Emily  shall  set  off  on  him  first. 
I  will  walk  till  I  am  tired,  and  then  sit 
down  by  the  roadside  till  she  comes  up. 
Then  she  shall  walk  and  I  will  ride, 
and  when  I  think  she  must  be  tired, 
I  will  tie  the  donkey  to  a  hedge  and 
walk  on  :  then  she  will  ride,  and,  by 
and  bye,  tie  him  again,  and  so  we  shall 
arrive  in  time."  They  wrent  in  this 
way ;  and,  as  the  carriage  got  on  long 


before  them,  they  found  every  thing 
ready  for  tea  on  the  hill  when  they  got 
there.  The  others  had  made  a  fire 
with  sticks,  boiled  the  kettle  on  it, 
spread  the  things  on  the  grass,  and  it 
was  all  very  nice  and  pleasant. 


One  morning  Charley  went  out  to 
play  in  the  fields  before  breakfast.  It 
was  very  warm,  and  he  felt  thirsty. 
There  w^as  a  little  girl  sitting  on  a  style, 
he  asked  her  if  she  knew  of  any 


so 


water  near.    She  said,  no  :  but  he  could 


buy  milk  from  her  mother.  Charley 
pulled  out  a  penny,  and  the  little  girl 
ran  for  the  milk,  and  brought  it  in  a 
mug.  Charley  thanked  her,  and  asked 
what  her  name  was.  She  said  Molly. 

"  Well,  Molly,  suppose  we  play  at 
something/'  said  he.  She  said  they 
could  play  at  hunt  frog,  and  began  to 
run  after  a  frog  that  was  hopping 
among  the  grass ;  she  soon  caught  it 
and  squeezed  it  in  her  hand.  "  Put  it 
down,"  said  Charley  ;  "  you  will  hurt 
it,"  and  he  gave  her  arm  such  a  slap 
that  she  dropped  the  poor  frog ;  but 
she  took  up  a  great  stone  to  throw  at  it. 

"  You  nasty,  cruel  girl ! "  cried 
Charley,  and  he  seized  the  stone  and 
threw  it  at  her.  She  began  to  cry. 
Charley  was  very  sorry  now.  He  led 
Molly  home  to  his  mamma,  and  she 
gave  her  breakfast  and  tried  to  teach  her 
not  to  hurt  creatures.  She  had  taught 
Charley  so ;  but  she  told  him  he  was 
very  wrong  to  throw  the  stone.  That  was 
not  the  way  to  teach  Molly  to  be  kind. 


One  cold  morning  in  spring,  as  Bessy 
was  running  about,  she  saw  a  little 
brown  thing  that  moved.  She  went 
up  to  it,  and  what  should  it  be  but  a 
little  robin  that  had  fallen  out  of  its 
nest  -,  so  she  took  the  poor  little  thing 


between  her  hands,  and  carried  it  in  to 
her  mother.  Her  mother  said  she 
must  keep  it  very  warm,  and  try  to 
feed  it  with  some  soft  food,  such  as 
bread  and  milk,  and  chopped  egg. 

Bessy  found  some  soft  wool,  and  put 
it  in  a  small  basket,  and  made  it  hollow 
like  a  nest ;  and  in  this  she  placed  the 
little  bird,  and  then  covered  it  lightly 
with  more  wool.  Then  she  tried  to 
make  it  eat,  but  could  not.  The  poor 
little  bird  trembled,  and  shut  its  eyes, 
and  looked  very  ill.  "  Oh  dear,  what 
shall  I  do!"  cried  Bessy.  "It  will  die; 
I  know  it  will  die." 

She  saw  a  little  bit  of  stick  lying 
near,  so  she  dipped  it  in  the  food,  and 
took  care  to  make  a  piece  of  egg  go 
upon  it ;  then  she  tapped  at  the  beak, 
and,  oh  joy  !  the  robin  opened  its  beak 
and  took  the  food.  It  got  tame,  and 
soon  it  could  fly ;  but  it  came  back  to 
Bessy  when  she  went  out,  and  hopped 
in  at  the  window,  and  sang  to  her,  and 
was  a  great  pleasure  to  her. 


This  poor  boy  is  blind.  He  would 
be  very  sad,  if  it  were  not  for  his  kind 
sister  Amy ;  but  she  loves  him  dearly, 
all  the  more  dearly  because  he  is  blind, 
and  she  leads  him  about,  and  reads 
pretty  stories  to  him,  and  plays  with 


him,  and  makes  him  as  happy  as  she 
can.  Poor  fellow  !  He  cannot  see  the 
green  fields,  and  trees,  and  flowers,  nor 
the  bright  sun,  and  stars,  and  moon, 
nor  the  faces  of  the  friends  who  love 
him  :  but  he  has  many  pleasures.  He 
can  hear  the  birds  sing,  and  the  voices 
of  those  that  talk  to  him ;  and  smell 
the  sweet  scent  of  flowers,  and  feel  the 
pleasant  air  and  sunshine  ;  and  it  is  a 
great  joy  to  him  to  hold  Amy  by  the 
hand,  and  know  that  she  is  near  him. 
He  loves  her  very  much. 

He  is  to  go  to  a  school  for  the  blind 
soon.  There  they  will  teach  him  to 
read.  He  cannot  see  the  letters ; 
but  they  make  all  the  letters  raised; 
then  the  blind  people  feel  with  the 
points  of  their  fingers,  and  find  out 
what  letters  they  are.  They  will  teach 
him  also  to  make  baskets,  and  mats, 
and  many  other  things  ;  and  be  sure 
Amy  will  always  help  him  :  and  so, 
though  he  is  blind,  he  wrill  be  able  to 
earn  a  little  and  to  be  useful. 


Did  you  ever  hear  any  one  play  the 
Guitar  ?  This  girl  that  you  see  in  the 
picture  holds  a  guitar  in  her  hands,  and 
is  going  to  play  on  it.  I  think  she  will 
sing  too.  She  will  make  sweet  sounds 
come  from  her  guitar,  and  will  sing  to 


it.  She  does  not  look  like  an  English 
girl.  I  think  she  comes  from  Spain. 
Her  hair  is  dressed  in  a  pretty  way, 
and  that  black  veil  she  has  over  her 
head,  and  hanging  down  her  back,  she 
can  draw  over  her  face  if  she  likes. 
What  a  bright  blue  jacket  she  has  on, 
and  a  pretty  striped  yellow  and  red 
skirt !  Then  look  at  the  large  bows  in 
her  shoes. 

Some  lady  must  have  asked  her  to 
come  in  to  her  drawing-room,  and  play 
and  sing  ;  for  you  see  she  is  standing 
in  a  fine  room,  and  leaning  against  a 
table  with  a  very  fine  red  cloth  on  it. 
The  lady  will  give  her  money  for  her 
music.  Poor  girl !  I  dare  say  she  longs 
to  go  back  to  her  own  country,  and 
will  go  as  soon  as  she  has  made  some 
more  money,.  Her  own  country  is 
much  warmer  than  England,  and  has 
brighter  blue  skies ;  and,  besides,  all 
the  friends  she  loves  are  there.  It  is 
sad  to  be  far  away  from  home.  I  hope 
she  will  soon  be  able  to  go  back. 


One  day  Kitty's  mamma  went  out, 
and  left  her  in  the  drawing-room,  and 
said :  "Be  sure  you  do  not  go  near  the 
parrot's  cage." 

Kitty  sat  for  a  good  while  reading  her 
story  book,  but  then  the  parrot  began  to 
say,  "  Pretty  Poll !"  So  Kitty  got  up, 
and  began  to  go  nearer  and  nearer. 

"  Poor  Polly,"  thought  Kitty,  "  she 
would  like  to  come  out;  and,  forget- 
ting what  her  mamma  had  said,  Kitty 
opened  the  cage  door.  Out  came  Polly, 
and  flew  to  the  arm  chair,  and  perched 
on  the  back. 

"Now  Polly,"  said  Kitty;  "come 
back  to  your  cage."  But  Polly  never 
moy6d  ;  so  Kitty  tried  to  catch  her,  but 
got  such  a  bite  from  Polly's  hard  beak, 
that  she  screamed  with  pain.  Polly 
screamed  much  louder,  and  made  noises 
like  laughing:  "  Ha  I  ha  !  ha  !  Oh,  lau!" 

Kitty  sank  down  crying  on  the  floor. 
When  she  looked  up  again  Polly  was 
gone  ;  and,  just  then,  her  mamma 
came  home.  Oh,  how  sorry  and 


ashamed  Kitty  was !  Polly  had  flown 
out  of  the  window;  and  it  took 
mamma,  and  Kitty,  and  all  the  ser- 
vants, many  hours  to  catch  her ;  at  last 
they  found  her  in  a  currant  bush,  and 
she"  had  stripped  all  the  fruit  off. 


What  is  the  matter  with  you,  poor 
boy?  What  a  woeful  face  you  are 
making,  and  how  you  cling  to  your 
sister;  I  really  believe  you  are  frightened 
at  the  dancing  bear.  The  other  boys 
are  looking  at  him  and  laughing.  Do 
not  be  such  a  coward.  I  hardly  know 
which  makes  most  noise ;  that  dog  with 
his  barking,  or  you  with  your  crying. 

You  may  be  sure  that  the  man  with 
the  drum  and  pandeaii  pipes  knows 
how  to  manage  the  bear ;  if  he  did 
not,  he  would  not  venture  to  bring  him 
out  among  people.  •** 

Poor  bear !  I  dare  say  he  could 
cry,  if  bears  ever  did  such  a  thing  as 
cry,  but  I  never  heard  of  their  doing 
it.  I  am  sure  he  does  not  like  being 
led  about  in  this  way,  and  made  to 
dance  ;  he  is  hot  and  tired,  and  feels 
very  cross.  I  know  he  does.  Look  at 
his  thick  coat  of  hair  ;  it  was  never 
meant  for  a  country  like  this,  and  to 
go  about  among  crowds  of  people  in 
dusty  roads  and  noisy  fairs.  He  longs 


to  be  far  away,  in  his  own  cold  country, 
in  the  cave  in  a  wild  forest,  where  he 
was  born  ;  it  was  a  sad  day  for  him 
when  the  hunters  caught  him,  and 
brought  him  away  to  be  tamed  and 


taught  to  dance. 


Blanche  had  a  pretty  little  dog  given 
to  her  ;  it  was  a  Skye  Terrier,  with  long 
hair,  so  long  that  its  eyes  were  almost 
hidden  under  it.  She  named  it  Fido  ; 
it  was  to  he  her  own  little  dog,  that 
she  was  to  take  care  of,  and  feed,  and 
do  every  thing  for.  She  used,  every 
morning,  to  comh  out  his  long  hair, 
and  then  brush  it  with  a  nice  soft 
brush,  till  it  looked  glossy.  Then  she 
gave  him  his  breakfast,  and  then  took 
him  out  for  a  walk.  She  was  so  afraid 
of  losing  him  that  she  tied  a  piece  of 
red  ribbon  to  his  collar  and  led  him ; 
but  when  he  got  older,  and  knew  her 
better,  she  was  able  to  let  him  run 
about  alone  without  fear,  if  she  was 
out  with  him  ;  it  would  not  have  been 
safe  to  let  him  go  by  himself,  because 
he  was  very  pretty,  and  some  one 
might  have  stolen  him. 

Fido  had  a  basket  of  his  own  to 
sleep  in,  with  clean  straw  in  the 
bottom,  and  slept  outside  Blanche's 
door.  When  she  was  dressed  in  the 


morning,  and  opened  her  door,  out  he 
jumped,  wagging  his  tail,  bounding 
round  her,  barking  for  joy,  as  if  he 
wanted  to  say  how  glad  he  was  to  see 
her  again  ;  then  she  patted  him,  and 
he  was  quite  pleased. 


Peter  had  his  three  cousins,  Rose, 
Alice,  and  George,  to  spend  New  Year's 
Day  with  him.  They  played  a  great 
many  games ,  he  showed  them  all  his 
toys  and  books.  After  dinner  they 
thought  they  would  dress  up,  and 


Peter  was  to  begin ;  lie  went  out  of 
the  room,  and,  after  a  little  while,  in 
came  such  a  figure !  He  had  an  im- 
mense face,  a  blue  cap,  a  yellow  coat, 
and  a  red  cloak  that  trailed  on  the 
floor  after  him,  and  he  wrent  roaming 
round  and  round  the  room,  saying : 
"  Fee,  Fo,  Fum!"  like  the  giants  in 
Jack  the  Giant  Killer. 

At  first  they  all  burst  out  laughing  ; 
but,  after  a  little  while,  Alice  began  to 
be  afraid.  "  Do  speak,  Peter/'  she 
cried,  "is  it  really  you?  Leave  off  say- 
ing '  Fee,  Fo,  Fum/  and  say  it  is  you :"' 
but  it  was  of  no  use.  He  went  on 
marching  about,  and  then  ran  after  her 
and  tried  to  catch  her.  She  ran  away, 
screaming,  round  the  room,  got  on  the 
sofa,  jumped  behind  it,  and  tried  to  get 
out  at  the  door.  At  last  he  drove  her 
into  a  corner,  and  caught  her,  and  she 
was  almost  crying,  when  George  and 
Rose  seized  him  behind,  and  pulled  off 
his  ugly  mask  and  cap,  and  there  was 
Peter  with  his  good-natured  face. 


There  was  a  fair  at  a  village  in 
Ireland,  and  a  set  of  boys  came  before 
any  one  else,  and  got  quite  tired  of 
waiting  There  they  stood  by  an  old 
wall,  and  it  was  cold,  and  they  began 
to  feel  cross,  and  were  very  hungry;  so 


one  of  them,  his  name  was  Pat  O'Grady, 
said  he  would  dance  a  hornpipe.  There 
you  may  see  him  dancing.  He  looked 
very  gay,  for  he  had  put  on  his  father's 
red  waistcoat,  it  was  too  large  for  him, 
but  he  did  not  care  for  that,  and  he 
went  on  so  merrily  that  the  others  be- 
gan to  laugh ;  at  least  Mike  Tooley,  that 
had  a  blue  coat  and  yellow  trousers, 
did  ;  but  Dan  Crowter  still  looked  cross. 

While  Pat  was  dancing,  little  Miss 
Gorman,  the  farmer's  daughter,  came 
by  with  her  two  little  brothers,  and 
stood  looking  at  him  and  laughing. 
"  Well  done !"  she  cried,  as  he  ended 
with  a  caper.  "  And  it  is  wrell  done," 
said  Pat,  "if  you  knew  how  hungry 
I  am."  Away  she  ran  to  her  father, 
who  was  in  the  field.  "  Give  them 
some  breakfast,  father,"  she  said ;  "he 
does  dance  so  nimbly  '' 

So  the  farmer  called  them  in,  and 
gave  them  a  good  mess  of  potatoes  and 
herrings ;  and  Pat  danced  his  hornpipe 
again  to  thank  him. 


Tliis  is  a  picture  of  a  poor  Slave  Girl, 
of  New  Orleans,  in  the  United  States. 
She  has  got  a  task  to  do,  and  is  work- 
ing hard  to  do  it ;  but  see  how  she 
has  started  at  the  sound  of  some  one 
coming :  she  is  afraid  she  may  not  have 

o  * 


done  her  work  rightly,  and  that  she 
will  be  beaten. 

But  there  is  joyful  news  in  the  world 
now.  There  are  no  more  slaves  in  all 
that  great  country,  the  United  States  ; 
they  are  all  set  free.  Is  not  that  joyful 
news  ?  England  had  set  her  slaves 
free  years  ago ;  and  now  there  will 
not,  much  longer,  be  any  slaves  in 
countries  that  call  themselves  Christian. 
In  other  countries,  where  people  arc 
savage  and  know  no  better,  there  still 
will  be. 

The  poor  black  people  that  were 
slaves  are  very  badly  off,  a  great  many 
of  them.  Some  have  not  found  masters ; 
some  are  idle,  now  they  are  not  driven 
to  work  with  the  whip ;  some  are  very 
stupid  and  helpless,  for  when  they 
were  slaves  no  one  taught  them  any- 
thing. Many  kind  people  arc  trying 
to  teach  them  and  help  them. 

Be  joyful,  little  children,  that  you 
live  in  days  when  slavery  is  coming  to 
an  end.

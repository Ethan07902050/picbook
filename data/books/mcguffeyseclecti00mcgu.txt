The flattering success of Mcfriiffey's Revised Readers, 
and the inquiry for more primary reading matter to be 
used in the first year of school work, have induced the 
Publishers to prepare a REVISED PRIMER, which may be 
used to precede the First Reader of any w r ell arranged 
series. 

The method pursued is the same as that m McGufFey's Re- 
vised Readers, and the greatest possible care has been taken 
to insure a gradation suited to the youngest children. Only 
about six new words are to be mastered in each lesson. 
These new words and the new elementary sounds are always 
to be found in the vocabulary of the lesson in which they 
are first used. 

The plan of the book enables the teacher to pursue the 
Phonic Method, the Word Method, the Alphabet Method, 
or any combination of these methods. 

Illustrations of the best character have been freely sup- 
plied, and the skilled teacher will be able to use them to 
great advantage. 

The script exercises throughout the book and the slate 
exercises at the close, have been specially written and care- 
fully engraved for this Primer; they may be used to teach 
the reading of script, and as exercises in learning to write. 

In the full confidence that the public will appreciate a 
cheap and attractive Primer of this character, the Publishers 
have spared no expense to make this book equal, m #ype, 
paper, and illustrations, to any that have been issued from 
their Press.

Bess, do you hear a noise? 

Yes, Tom; what is it? 

It is the mill by our house; 
logs are cut there. 

How do they cut the logs, 
Tom, with an ax? 

Not with an ax, Bess; it is 
too hard work; they cut them 
with a saw. 

May we not go and see the 
mill at work, Tom? 

Yes, I think so. The air is cool, 
and we can walk in the shade. 
We should go soon, Bess, or the 
pile of wood will be gone. 

Our two goats and the cart 
are here, Tom; we can ride to 
the mill. It is not up hill, and 
the goats can pull us fast.

Kate is a good baby; but she

Bess likes to sit near the baby, 
and to rock her in the crib.

Henry Black and Ned Bell live 
near our house. They go to school, 
and I see them go by each day 
with their books and slates. 

Miss May tells the girls and 
boys that they should be at the 
schoolhouse when the bell rings. 
So Henry walks fast, and is first 
at school. He is a good boy.

and wants to keep the rule of 
the school. 

Ned is not a good boy. I do 
not think he likes to go to school 
or to church. 

I saw him try to kill a quail 
with a stone. The quail is too 
quick a bird for that, and Ned 
did not hurt it ; but I know that 
a good child would not try to kill 
a bird.

LESSON XLV.-REVIEW. 

One day Nat and I sat on the 
high hill by the sea, where the 
tall lighthouse stands. We could 
look far out, and could see the 
ships at sea. 

As we sat there, we saw a 
man near by, with some sheep and 
lambs. The man had a pipe in 
his mouth. He sat with us, and 
let the sheep eat the grass. 

What fun it is to see lambs 
play! It made us laugh to see 
them. 

The man said that once, when 
the sheep and lambs were out in 
the snow, an old wolf took one 
of the lambs, and ran off with 
it, 

I think that men should watch

Should we not then love him?
